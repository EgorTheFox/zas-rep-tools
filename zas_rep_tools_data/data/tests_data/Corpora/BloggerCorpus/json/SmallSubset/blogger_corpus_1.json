When I was walking to the co-op to do my shift tonight, I was totally overtaken by the mood sifting through the streets.  It was very damp out, and hovering in that moment right before it starts misting.  This air brought out all the smells hanging around. The main one I thought I could distinguish reminded me of homemade soup and a thick slice of bread.  I could have sworn we were nearing the end of September more so than August.  The leaves are already drying up and twisting off of their branches.  I walked by the open door to a bar, not quite ready for business, and caught a whiff of cigarette smoke.  It's one of those moments where it's a comforting smell, reminding me of friends and lost loves.  This is the kind of evening when a hand made quilt is necessary along with a pet to give you kisses.   Then I remembered it's a Thursday.  I wanted to be back in high school, when I had the Thursday night crew to look forward to.  I got invited to it when Channah and I became friends.  It was usually just a few of us, but sometimes more if folks were back in town.  We always got together at Jamison's house around seven o'clock for good coffee, conversation, and an arthouse flick.  I loved being there, especially on those colder nights.  Jamison would hand roll cigarettes and put on a pot of coffee, while his family's big standard poodle, Caesar, would clatter around.  We would eventually put the movie on, and then have to reluctantly amble home once it was over.  It was almost always Nilufar, Jamison, Channah, me, Cecilia, and Saskia, Isaac, Margo, Mindy if they were in town.  Sometimes others came too.  After some time, we wouldn't even do stuff centered around the movie.  We might make dinner, or smoke fruit flavored tobacco from the sheesha pipe Jamison had from living in Egypt.  One summer night we had a sleepover and swam at midnight.  Afterwards we crawled into the car to go to the grocery store to fill that hunger that only swimming can give you.  There was also the night (headed back from a movie?) in Jamison's station wagon where it was pouring rain, and on Lowell, his windsheild wiper gave out.  Everyone stuck their heads out the window to see the road.  Tonight, years later and living in Brooklyn, everything aligned to have all of that flood back into my memory.  What's sad is that I am not in close contact with any one of those people currently.  There are no hard feelings, and when we run into each other it's always nice...we just all got busy...\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...keepin' a look-out...  Yesterday I saw lots of interesting folks all around town.  Making my way up the stairs to our subway platform, sweet sounds of a mandolin and a steel guitar hit my ears.  Usually, people do not play at our station, so it was a nice morning treat.  Waiting for the train, I saw the guy with two light blue puffs of hair that I had seen walking home the evening before, as well as the punky, pale, colored hair, lesbian couple I had seen on the train the day before.  As I emerged on to the street at the 23rd street C/E station, I ran into Jacob who I work with on his way to a bagel store.  On 22nd street in between 8th and 9th ave., the old man who is there every morning exchanged smiles with me.  During lunch, I saw an interesting fellow in a red shirt with tons of rubber bands around his sleeves holding in various bulky objects.  It was a unique solution to not carrying a bag.  The train ride home was the usual squish of business folks, loud teenagers, little kids, etc.  On the corner of my street, I ran into a guy who works with me in childcare at the co-op.  He doesn't even  live in the neighborhood.  Okay, so...yeah.  That entry was probably only worthwhile to me.  I just enjoy human watching.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...shake your money maker...  Man, I should really not work at a bookstore, because I just keep running across things I want to have in my bookshelves.  I guess out of all addictions I could have ended up with, books is not such a bad one.  I have learned much restraint. I need to spend some time making books.  I haven't made one in quite some time...Now I have a work surface that is all mine (though the cats are trying to claim it like everything else!) and no excuse not to start MAKING something, anything.  My head is waiting for a blank piece of paper.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...red in the face...  A weekend beach escape was great...courtesy of the DiCarlos.  Fire Island is really perfect.  Even though it was cloudy on the main day we were there, it was perfect.  I had the ocean all to my self for a moment in time.  A seagull cried out a warning as I noticed a constellation of sand on the back of my hand.  It was such a heartbreaking, grey, beautiful day.  Of course, today was perfect in a different way...the sun was out, the sky was BRIGHT, the waves were fantastic.  Luckily, we got to enjoy it before we took the ferry back to the air-conditioned rodeo-of-a-city we live in.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...space seed...  Tonight I am babysitting Georgia.  She is four going on five, and never ceases to amaze me with the things she thinks about.  A couple weeks ago we were playing with her legos.  All of them are the usual red, yellow, green, blue, except for one that is shiny and silver.  She held this particular lego in her hand, turning it around slowly, and said, \" I don't know where this came from.\"   I thought she simply meant she couldn't remember who gave it to her, but then she continued,  \" I don't know how we got here, how this planet got here.\"  It took me a second to respond, but then I did with the usual, \" Well, everyone has a lot of different explanations for how things got here, and no one is either right or wrong.  It's still a mystery.\"  After a little more elaboration, and a couple moments of silence, Georgia decided it had to be seeds. ... Then she was only interested in what buildings we were working on.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...i am awake...  Cat in my lap, husband actually asleep before me, a productive day behind me, a bug just flew into view and I think I killed it - I'm not sure why, empty mason jar wanting to be full, bladder wanting to be empty, ol' clunky chugging away, barefeet patting on the linoleum, allergies found my forwarding address, heard some cicadas today!!! - didn't know they existed here at all, drew an anatomically correct eyeball to embroider on a pillow, did dishes to tool - one of the best bands ever, started a new book that Joan recommended - Empire Falls, been on a cooking jag, figured out part of an amelie song and a byrds song on the melodica, watched the teen choice awards while drinking wine and coffee, talked with my sleepy sister - today was her first day back teaching, prayin' for rain.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...help me!...  My archives are driving me up the wall!  Can anyone tell me how to magically make them appear and work?!  Thanks.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...what can you offer...  Do you ever think about how riduculous money is?  How were we all made to believe that simple pieces of paper and metal actually hold power, and are worth working for?  It's a spell of mass proportions.  What if we went back to trading object for object?  I do not know if that would necessarily (is that how it's spelled?) be better, but just think for a second...What things would totally disappear if we did that?  I have no clue.  Would there still be people who made cars, or appliances, and what would you have to do for them in order to get one?  To some, playing a heart breaking song might be worth thousands, but to others it could mean a years worth of crops, or free access to your body, or a baby, or a fantastic meal.  It's all relative.   Do most people even know how to make anything anymore?!  If it came down to it, would people re-learn to spin yarn again, weave fabric, and construct clothes?  Would more people learn ceramics, or how to build things, or whatever?  I guess money is convenient in that everyone has something they know how to do and they get paper for it to buy the things they do not know how to do, or the things they do, but just don't have time or energy to.  Has money made us uncreative and lazy?  It' s a vicious cycle of having to have it, even for basics, and having to work way too much for way too little.   What about the concept of plastic = money.  What about the stock market?  Our money isn't even physically backed by gold anymore...Imaginary, huge numbers.  What was it that Nasa just lost track of in space?...something that cost them four BILLION to build!  Did that money even change hands?  I seriously doubt it.  Man, we are so far gone. Okay...so now you know what a Sunday morning of too much coffee can do to me.  Actually this is part of my mind all of the time.  I've got to go buy groceries... \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...do a little dance...  Today is much better.  All of my future work is lined up and ready.  My only babysitting is picking up a really fun girl from school every day, and other than that, I am working at the Dia!  Art books, whee!  A weight has been lifted.  I have another book to recommend...this one is a kid's book, and is fabulous.  It was introduced to us by our friends the Freelings *The Grey Lady and the Strawberry Snatcher by Molly Garrett Bang *  So good.  Alright...I promise to be more exciting soon. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...oy...  Is there a full moon on the rise, or is there nothing to pin everything bad/weird on?  It's too hot to even care about anything...of course, I care about everything.  Man, even the cats are getting in on the craziness.  They want so bad to run outside.  I keep trying to explain how sorely disappointed they would be when they discovered  - man, I swear to something that Jeremy just! broke his favorite glass, I broke one earlier that's not even ours, I got a small shard in my finger cleaning it up, and Jeremy got one in his foot...things have got to get better right? - that there is no grass, not many birds, and hostile streets.  The cats just don't care.  They are like me, every place I should not be at the moment.  Anyway, do not fret dear friends.  It's just one of those days.  We'll see how things are when the fog lifts in the morning.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...in times of trouble...  Sometimes I like to make lists of things that make me happy:  anything involving Jeremy, stormy days, big sweaters, dandelion fuzz, driving through the southwest, a lovingly made meal, spending the day with a book, mail, the frenzied moment an idea strikes, working with wire, dancing to records with our cats, old suitcases, photographs, thinking of, or seeing my family and friends, frozen grapes on a hot summer day, spoons, when smell brings back a memory, history- familial and otherwise, multiples of small things, weaving, drinking from mason jars, sitting on the front stoop watching the world go by, talking with kids, wood floors, overalls, seeing them burn the prarie in Kansas, magnets, finding the cats in bizarre,small places. ...I'll stop tormenting you now;)   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...new york struttin'...  Saturday was a perfect Brooklyn appreciation day.  It was a great temperature out, and I got out of the house early.  Jeremy and I walked to his new place of work (a children's bookstore - locally owned,) which was having it's opening day.  I bought great kid's books, headed to the co-op for guacamole and pico de gallo materials, and sauntered home, bothering to stop and look in windows of stores I do not normally take time to.  Then it was phone calls, Jeremy came home for a bit (too many people working,) pico and other food making, last minute cleaning, a frosty glass of water...Suddenly food is ready, our neighbors are over, good breeze shootin', and friends from Colorado come in to town.  Perfect.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...bear with me...  I love to make lists and read books, so I am combining the two here.  I really enjoy being introduced to books by friends, so if you have any suggestions please email me!  These are just some of my favorite books: *anything written by Barbara Kingsolver, Isabel Allende, Dave Sedaris, Tom Robbins, and John Irving.  *Cruddy by Lynda Barry, *A Cook's Tour by Anthony Bourdain,  *The Autobiography of Malcom X as told to Alex Haley, *A Beginer's Guide To Constructing the Universe by Michael Schneider,  *Ode to Common Things by Pablo Neruda, *Geek Love by Katherine Dunn, *The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy by Tim Burton, *A Natural History of the Senses by Diane Ackerman.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...dusty books...  Yesterday I was wandering through various photo albums, when I came across the pictures of euclid trees in Australia covered with maps from the scribbly moth.  For those that do not know, scribbly moth  catepillars leave trails of digestive fluid on one kind of euclid tree, then go back and suck up nutrients.  The marks are left permanently.  I like to think of my art and writing in comparison to them.  We both leave behind a lot of residue to be looked at.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...stoop sittin' kind of day...  The moments before you open a letter are some of my favorite.  Someone took the time to create something just for you.  It takes only a minute at the most from when you take the letter inside to when you open it, but in that time, you investigate the weight, smell, and visual quality of the letter.  Then you get the added pleasure of opening the letter and discovering what it holds inside.    I have not been a great letter creator recently, but I am working on it.  I have to say I love the postal system, even though they raise prices, and lose stuff sometimes.  They are carriers of love, friendship, hatred, junk, everything.  What an interesting position to be in.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...ramblin'...  I could have sworn I heard the cicadas last night.  It was just city noises, and wishful thinking.  the cicadas have been persistant this year, not even bothering to pause during the day. they are frantic to get out just one more dusty call before they become a series of empty shells.  This is one of the essences of a Kansas City summer.  I miss it there.  I am discovering, though, the things that I love about New York (Brooklyn in particular) that will some day make my missing list.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...long time gone...  Whew...things have been busy.  I went back to Kansas City for the memorial.  It was good.  I love seeing my family.  I really did not have any time to see any friends except Johnny.  John took me out for a cup of coffee and some good conversation.  He also showed me a witch's house, but that is a different story.  It was nice to see a familiar face.  I had a fun time with all of my family though.  I got to spend the night in Piper and Nick's new house.  It is very nice, and surprisingly set up for how recently they had moved in!  I, of course spent plenty of time with my Ma.  She is very funny and fun.  I made her jaw hurt from talking so much!  I saw my Dad not only at the memorial, but I took lunch to him one morning.  We had a good time.  Then I saw Daddad!  Mom and I went over to his house to hang out for a while before going to dinner at Tippin's.  Afterwards we hung out more, and I found old photo albums - one solely dedicated to photos of my Mom throughout her upbringing.  A lot were of ones I had never seen before.  It was great to visit with Daddad.  He gets so forlorn when I leave...I just don't want too!  I needed to come back to my other home here, though.  I missed Jeremy so much.  When I arrived home (NY), I was greated by more familial trauma...no need to go into it...things are better.  So, life is semi-normal again.  Whatever that means.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...memorium...  My grandmother was a short stack of fun, intelligence, sassiness, and grace.  She was always there with a pun, a piece of candy, listening ears, a coke, lots of love, etc.  I will miss her greatly, but know that she is a lot happier wherever she is now.  As a young girl, she played lots of sports and ran -  and won! - city races.  She was a small girl with flaming red hair, and she beat those long legged girls!                                                                         She appeared in a photograph in the June 1935 edition of National Geographic.  It was an article about West Pointe, and she was a bridesmaid in her good friends wedding.  Her friend was marrying a West Pointe graduate.  People recognised her by her hair and beauty after the photo was published. She attended journalism school briefly at Kansas University. She worked in the offices of Alf Landen (as a secretary to his secretary I believe) while he was running for president, and made a lasting impression on every one there. She married my Grandfather, a doctor, and they had a love that most people now never find. They had two incredible children together, my father, and my aunt. She used to buy all the chemicals for my dad's crazy science experiments, because he was to young to purchase such toxic materials. She used to volunteer for the rehab in Kansas City. One time, she was walking down the street in KCK  carrying an umbrella, when a giant gust of wind came and picked her up.  She paddled her feet furiously trying to reach the ground, but could not, and all the people on the street could not believe their eyes! I loved spending the night at my Grandparent's home, because that meant we played Chinese checkers and other games, ate jumbo hot dogs, got our own room with our own TV and candy dish, told stories, ate giant cinnamon buns for breakfast, and had tons of other fun. My grandmother was the sharpest dresser in the world.  Always lovely slacks, skirts, and blouses.  Always very high high heels.  Her clothes and shoes matched perfectly and she had outfits of every color!  She always had on great jewelry, and had a million different brooches/pins - some lovely, some silly.  Sometimes for Halloween or other holidays, she would put seasonal stickers on her blouse collar, but it never looked weird. She used to do needlepoint, and made some really incredible things. She always had such nice, encouraging, honest things to say in cards and letters.  She wrote me letters all through college, and also when we moved here.   Grandma loved to take you out to lunch, and I loved to have lunch with her.  When we were kids, she would pick us up in her car and take us wherever we wanted to go - Tippin's, Houlihan's, Annie's Santa Fe, etc. - Sometimes we would run errands with her, and often she would swing by wherever to let us pick out a small  present for ourselves. Grandma knew all kinds of people and all of them absolutely adored her.  She has so many stories, and always knew the latest about anyone.  She adored crossword puzzles and was good at them!  Always did them in ink.  She also devoured books, especially mystery novels.  She always found time to read.  There are so many things that I could say about her...The words can't even come close to how awesome she was.  She will be missed. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...september, i'll remem-ember...  So...this week has been kind of glum, for reasons that I will be talking about in the not too distant future.  But for now, other things. Jeremy showed me some action...that is, the action in our piano!  He had his first two classes this week and is on his way to being a fantastic piano tuner.  I'm very proud of him.  There's a lot of stuff going on, on the inside of a piano.  Man, who invented them?  Who thought up all those intricate parts?  Who discovered/invented anything?  Phew...it makes me wonder sometimes...I'm not sure if I have ever discovered anything new.  I'm not exactly the inventor type, though I can build/create lots of different stuff.  When I was a kid, I wanted to be McGuyver really bad and make explosives from paper clips and erasers.  I could never quite get it to work...then again, I used to play QVC when I was alone sometimes.  I'd get a ring or something and do my best pitch as to why all my imaginary viewers needed this item and FAST.  It's not like my Mom, or anyone in my family, were QVC people either...  It's amazing I made so many friends.   So we'll end with...an ode to things, by none other than Pablo Neruda. I just feel in the mood for this, so indulge me.  I'm only doing the English translation though. This is one of my all time favorite poems, so enjoy.  I have a crazy, crazy love of things. I like pliers, and scissors. I love cups, rings,  and bowls- not to speak, of course, of hats. I love all things, not just the grandest, also the  infinite- ly small- thimbles, spurs, plates, and flower vases.  Oh yes, the planet  is sublime! It's full of pipes weaving hand-held through tobacco smoke, and keys and salt shakers- everything, I mean, that is made by the hand of man, every little thing: shapely shoes, and fabric, and each new bloodless birth of gold, eyeglasses, carpenter's nails, brushes, clocks, compasses, coins, and the so-soft softness of chairs.  Mankind has built oh so many perfect  things! Built them of wool and of wood, of glass and  of rope: remarkable tables, ships, and stairways.  I love  all things, not because they are passionate or sweet-smelling but because, I don't know, because this ocean is yours, and mine: these buttons and wheels and little  forgotten treasures, fans upon whose feathers love has scattered its blossoms, glasses, knives and  scissors- all bear the trace of someone's fingers on their handle or surface, the trace of a distant hand lost in the depths of forgetfulness.  I pause in houses, streets and  elevators, touching things, identifying objects that I secretly covet: this one because it rings, that one because it's as soft as the softness of a woman's hip, that one there for its deep-sea color, and that one for its velvet feel.  O irrecvocable river  of things: no one can say that I loved only  fish, or the plants of the jungle and the field, that I loved only those things that leap and climb, desire, and survive. It's not true: many things conspired to tell me the whole story. Not only did they touch me, or my hand touched them: they were  so close that they were a part of my being, they were so alive with me that they lived half my life and will die half my death. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...where the heart is...  The other day I was walking down fourth avenue (the one in Brooklyn, by our place) thinking about how for the first week or two when we moved here, how I barely left the apartment, especially alone.  I had never thought that I would be even slightly scared of a place I live in.  It's not like I had been used to living in the best neighborhoods in Kansas City.  Maybe I was afraid I might actually like it here.  Now of course, I walk down the street like nobody's business.  People recognize me, smile and nod.  I am familiar.   I think walking and taking public transportation make you much more a part of your community.  You begin to notice patterns, especially if you are doing things at the same time each day.  I like walking into my favorite corner store on fourth, or the mexican grocery, or flowers and coffee, or our bank, or aniello's, or taco nuevo mexico, and they know us.  I can weave easily through the people on the street, and I know all the characteristics of each street and sidewalk.  It's a different experience than what I was used to in K.C. In the Kansas City area (Lawrence included) it is a understanding of the landscape from the perspective of a car.  I do know parts by foot, very well actually, but the majority is taken in from the driver's seat preferably.  I love cruising around.  Some routes are like my favorite pair of pants, that pair you never want to wash because they would have to be off of your body.  I knew exactly where you could or could not take a left turn, where cars would be parked at any time of day on various streets, almost to the minute how long it should take me from point a to point b, etc.  I also know my car, and how it handles every situation.   Thinking about it, people knew us in Kansas City too.  It just was not necessarily at strictly neighborhood places.  My neighborhood was all over that town.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...just slide...  Everyone is so quiet on the subway in the morning.  People are either absorbed into their various papers (or pretending to be,) or sitting there with their eyes closed.  No one wants to be singled out and noticed.  This morning on the C train there was a woman a year or two older than me who was silently crying.  I did not even notice until the woman in the seat across from hers handed her a tissue.  When the tissue lady got off a few stops later, the crying one smiled and gave her thanks.  The other woman leaned down and whispered something...It was very touching in many ways.  First, that something could be so wrong or sad that it would make you cry on the subway, and second, a stranger's compassion.  That simple exchange filled me with happiness and hope.  It seems so much here (probably every where) that people avoid unnecessary contact. On the way home in the late afternoon, people are again quiet, though not as much as in the morning.  So many look like they are lacking iron and sunlight.  It's not even winter yet!  I think too      many people are working jobs that do not satisfy them.   My jobs now require me to spend much more time on public transportation than I normally enjoy, but I also get to walk about three miles a day.  This rules!  I have to be in a hurry, but it feels good.  It is a positive tired at the end of the day.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...lap it up...  This morning, in my kitchen, coffee brewing, I looked out our window to steal a glimpse of the neighbors bursting garden, and I spied Mama cat on her side with her three kittens drinking.  The almost all black one finished first, and bounded away to hide underneath the squash plants.  After awhile, Mama decided the other two had enough...the grey and white one kept trying at it.  Soon they were all wrestling, while the Ma daintily perched on a bucket type thing to help herself to a drink of water.  It was beautiful.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...not much action...  I've been viewing everything from the inside lately, even though the outside feels fantastic!  I've been inside the apartment, work, the subway, a taxi, other people's apartments...Not much time to lazily stroll about.    We celebrated Rosh Hashanah on Friday with dinner at Peter and Joanne's.  It was great!  Bea was there, and Brian, and Chris.  Joanne and Peter made a WONDERFUL meal (all vegetarian!- that's so nice,) and then we just talked, and gossiped, and laughed a lot.  Jeremy and I had a really great time.  I miss my family a lot, but I am so glad that we are near some of Jeremy's relatives.  Yesterday a piano entered our midst.  It's begging to be tuned... The cats enjoy rolling all over it.  Frank looked very startled when Jeremy started playing it while he was on top.  They have never lived with a piano before!    Piper and Nick have bought a house!!!  By the time we visit K.C. next, they should have been moved in for months.  That's so nice for them.  They have been in the apartment for so long.  I don't get to say goodbye to it...(oh, it's not that tragic!)  I wish I could help decorate it...not that Piper would agree with all my suggestions:)  A house...sigh.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...on a plane...  A year ago, today, we were headed back to Kansas City from visiting Jeremy's Great Aunt May here in New York City.  We knew this was most likely the last time that we would be seeing her, and she had that feeling as well.  It was a really wonderful weekend though...After dinner one night, we sat around her table talking, when we noticed that a HUGE full moon was on the rise.  It moved so quickly!  May lifted out of her seat to get a better view.  The three of us just sat in silence for a minute.   May gave us an engagement card and present that weekend.  She told me how happy she was that I was joining the family.  She said lots of great things, as I know some of you out there know. So, we kissed her goodbye on Tuesday, and her sitting at the table is the last we physically knew of May.  I can't really express through words on a blog what she was like... That's it...luckily, we weren't on a flight a week later...\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...smell my feet...  Yay for Halloween!  I've got the decals up(ghosts and pumpkins, bats and cats) to let the kiddies know we are friendly, and I've got a bowl full of candy(kit kats, skittles, and hershey miniatures).  I'm also sporting a black turtle neck (I'm going as a New Yorker...just kidding) with the skeleton stickers around the collar (just like my Grandma!)  No costume this year.  I'm not very creative lately...I will go through a run-down of things I have been in previous years - in no particular order - a princess, carebear, punk rocker(second grade!) , sleepy-time girl (I just wore pajamas), aerobics instructor, gypsy, giant tea bag, voodoo doll...I know there have been more, but my memory is obviously blocking them for some reason.  Let me know what you are for Halloween, what you handed out, what you received, etc...all the gory details!  Happy Halloween!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...wishing i could see you...  I really want to run into people I know on the streets here.  I'm not sure why.  I keep getting the vibe like I am going to.  Actually it already happened a bit.  I've had two KCAI buddies come into the Dia by chance and run into me working!  Jesse and John!  It's fun.  I've just been thinking a lot about people who occupy my past more than my present and maybe even future.  I love where I am as a person right now, and I take nothing back...I just miss some of the way things used to happen.  I like to remember...late nights at Jenny's house, sitting around the kitchen table, or doing crazy stuff...taking late night walks or drives with friends...hanging out at Tony's apartment with him and Mandylan and others...fun nights with Maralie and also Eli and Tim...dressing up to go to the grocery store or wherever...staying up all night talking with Mike A...late nights in studio, and also just studio in general...getting letters from Sarah and Julie, and an occassional visit...etc.  There is so much more...I really do not like letting people slowly slip from my life.  You stop one day and realize where have they gone?  New people have moved in, but create their own space - never taking over where someone else used to stand.  Alright, this is making me too wistful...  ...memory of the day...  The image of driving down that lonely Arizona road and looking over to see dusty, cracked cowboy boots coverin' every fence post for a good mile or two, keeps playing like a bouncy 16mm reel in my head.  Here's to hopin' they still populate that stretch of road.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...hidden moments...  The other night, around nine o'clock, I was walking down ninth street in our neighborhood.  It was chilly, so I was trying to move fast, plus look slightly tough in case anyone wanted to mess with me.  Then I noticed an older man standing in his little front cement garden space that we have here, except he wasn't just standing...he was doing tai chi!  It was so beautiful.  He was aligning himself with this crazy town!  You have to be creative about finding your own space here to be quiet and relax.   ...L-O-L-A LOLA...  Lola says some awfully funny things to me in our travels.  Jeremy got to experience them recently, because he came to work with me on Monday.  Here are some examples:  We were on the bus, and she was sitting on her silly putty egg pretending to be a Mama bird when suddenly she yells, cracking up while saying it, \" The egg rolled under my VAGINA!\"   She's very into talk like that (she's four)  We were talking to a man in the park who had a dog, and he was asking Lo about her dog...she was just telling him whatever, but then declared that her dog has a penis that he licks!  Well...it's true!  She also stated the other day while waiting for the bus,\"Where's the damn bus!\"  I said, \"Lo-la...\"  and she very calmly explained to me that it's okay because some people say that sometimes...true again, I could not argue.  One last thing...she sings perfectly the song Lola AND The Velvet Underground song I'm Sticking With You (which is one that Jer and I sing together)  Her parents have great taste in music.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...the streets of new york...  Yesterday was a particularly smelly day here in good 'ol NY.  I'm not sure why exactly, but I smelled a much wider variety of fragrances than I normally do.  On the subway was some man who had the odor of that cherry-flavored putty stuff they use to make dental molds.  Wonder what he does at home!  I think I also caught traces of Rodenticide in the air.  On the street was the normal multiple types of exhaust, food smells (baked goods, honey-roasted nuts, burning soft pretzels...) as well as leaves burning somewhere.  Isn't that pretty much illegal everywhere, but so many people do it!  I also took in a snort full of someone smoking a joint on my way into work.  That's another constant smell on the streets here!  Other scents encountered during the day: dust, magic markers, movie theater, candles, and human waste to name a few.  Lovely!  The sniffer is on the prowl!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...you say it's your birthday...  Normally I don't inform people it's my birthday...well, except those who already have it ingrained in their head, then I make them celebrate me for the month of October! Ha.  So, on October 21,1978 at 2:16 am (Eastern Time)  I was born in Fairfax, Virginia.  My sister asked my Mama and Daddad (my Mom's parents) who were in town for the event if I was black or white.  She was only four and thought you just get whatever!  I love that!  Jeremy, of course, thinks she knew something about what my Mom had been up to on the side.  My Mom was not up to anything to set the record straight.  In my first moments captured on film, I look exactly like my Dad...a large, round, bright red head, and a confused/befuddled look on my face.  I still have the huge head as my sister and others like to lovingly point out!  So...yay for my parents for copulating, and for the month of October, and for being a Libra, and for all my fun friends and family!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...morning...  Good-morning campers!  I love Saturday, because I don't work!!!  I still get up relatively early though.  It's nice having quiet morning time to myself.  I love Jeremy tons, but it is enjoyable to see him asleep in our warm bed, and to have time to read and write.  This morning I am sitting in pajama bottoms stolen from my husband and my old Theater for Young America t-shirt.  Earlier I was looking at some old zines...good 'ol friends.  The cats are actually sleeping.  I'm getting ready to make breakfast and coffee.  It's going to be a good day.  Hoping yours is too!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...weather report...  Jeremy told me I talk a lot about weather in my blog.  Yeah.  I love weather so much.  I constantly complain about it (a couple weeks into real winter, \"It's so cold!  God, where oh where is summer!\" ... a couple weeks into real summer, \"I wish it would get chilly so I could wear my winter clothes!  I'm so hot!\"), but I love all kinds.  They are predicting a real doozy of a storm for tomorrow.  In some ways, woo-hoo!, I love a good rip roarin' storm (hope it's like the mid-west variety.) In other ways...man, I have to walk in that...a lot...with a kid part of the time...and no super hardy shoes...(softly)damn.  Weather is very tied in with my memories, just like smell.  You know what, just the other day I was wishing there existed a perfume that smelled exactly like that fresh outdoors electricity right before a crazy storm smell.  That is my kind of perfume!  Also, desert in various stages of bloom perfume would be nice.  Okay, I am a total nerd...pay no attention to me! ;)  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...brewin'...  Things I came in contact with today: a scritchy-on-papers-early- in-the-morning cat, a blaring alarm clock that was starting to lose the battle, a washcloth, the same outfit I wore yesterday because it's so damn comfy (a new sweater!),  a bowl of yogurt with grapenuts and fruit, some zines, a toothbrush, a goodbye snuggle, our neighbor Nancy on the way to the subway - all the way to Jay Street, a large cup of coffee, a chilly yet pleasant walk, an empty office, mail orders, emails, my boss and her son Otto, chocolates she brought from Frankfurt, entering books, a peanut butter/jelly sandwhich on the go, a very happy Lola, the various folks we chat with on the bus, a stop at the dog park in Union Square, a Curious George reading, Lola's mom, the subway home - daydreaming, an encounter with my landlord - grrr, a half-hour with my husband (uh, not with with okay? :) some re-heated added to Chinese food, t.v., cat snuggles inter-mingled with scritchy on books, more t.v. (Buffy was on), weird voices when I tried to log-on (I swear I am sane), internet browsing, blog-writing, on to...seeing Jeremy soon, chit-chatting, flannel sheets, glorious sleep...repeat. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...mmm...pie...  Today is a day for baking cheddar cheese buttermilk biscuits and apple pie.  I have been looking forward to this for days.  Is that sad?  I just don't often have time to bake and I love it.  I have never attempted these particular items either, so it is an adventure.    Last night we went and saw some bands with old Kansas folks (people Jer knows from KU) in them who now live here.  It was really fun.  I got to meet a lot of new people and they were all very nice.  The music was also great, in particular Brian and Laura's band - Dust Dive I think the name is.  It was very...I can't explain it any other way than it made me homesick, happy, want to cry, etc.  Laura plays violin in it some...great!  It was a long night.  Yesterday I complained for the first part of the day about having to walk in the rain so much.  Then, on my way to pick up Lola - it was steadily pouring as it did all day - I passed by a homeless man in a doorway, curled up sleeping and absolutely soaked.  I realised that I may be uncomfortable for a few hours, but at least I know I have somewhere to head home and dry up.  Man...those pants of his are never going to dry in this weather.   Lola was actually fantastic yesterday.  We had no complaining or crying or anything.  We went to the Barnes and Noble in Union Square to read until it was time to meet her Mom at Eli's daycare.  We just read a ton of books and she was very in to being mellow.  No complaints even about rain!  I was so happy and grateful.  Jeremy got to talk to Erin from Colorado yesterday on the phone while I was at work.  She's really great.   She and Joey came for a visit a couple months ago...it was good times.  Anyway, love to you Erin if you're out there - I will talk with you soon.  We are going to visit Rick soon.  We are very happy Rick is alive and doing well.  I know he's out there - so lots of love to you.  Joan and Rachel bought a place in England! (Well, Rachel didn't buy it really) It sounds nice, and they even get all the furnishings!  Everyone is excited for them and suddenly trying to arrange trips to England :)  So yay!  That's it for now.  I've got to go prep the kitchen.  Enjoy your days.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...casual friday...  Yay!  It's Friday! Usually that is not always cause for celebration considering I do not really have a weekend away from work, BUT...this week I do not have to work Sunday or Monday!  Today though, I have to stay with Lola until five.  It's rainy out and I'm sure she will not be thrilled to see me.  She has gotten it in her head that I am very mean and bad and she likes to inform me of that...frequently.  Yeah, I sure am the devil for buying her chocolate milk, reading stories to her, and never yelling.  I know she's just four...I also know my future kids will probably do similar stuff, so why do I put up with it from a kid who is not even mine?!  Grrr.  What's frustrating is that she is lots of fun when she is happy.  Okay, enough of work!  Work be gone!!! It's chilly, and rainy, and such a great day for cuddling with your husband under a quilt and laughing.  That's where I will be mentally all day.  I am going to stay in the space of warmth and hot beverages and good books and kisses and cats.  In reality I'll be patrolling the streets, on the lookout for smiles.  Tough assignment on a day such as today.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...the fall tickles...  It's pretty chilly out, and I am so glad due to the fact that I can now wear sweaters and long-sleeves.  Some of my favorite clothes are fallish/wintery ones.  What should I wear today...  Our neighbors with the fantastic garden finally picked their HUGE squash that was hanging off this rope thing they had suspended.  Recently, I had been secretly hoping that it would fall on it's own before they could pick it.  That's mean, but it would have been strangely satisfying to see that much destroyed squash on the ground.  I am glad they were able to pick it though.  I need to calm down some.  Fall is in my bones and making me wild.  I don't mean to be that way, and I don't like to be upset or mean.  My apologies to anyone who has come into contact with that part of me recently.  I shouldn't even blame it on fall...fall is the best...maybe I can blame it on Mercury! :)  Someone told me recently that it was in retrograde(?) I think that's the right one, and that it was righting itself soon.  In it's wake in my life it has left broken internet and credit card machines at work (oh, madness,) getting upset about inane things, getting very defensive, stressed, tired, etc.  Yeah...blame it on Mercury...that's the ticket.  I watched Bones catch an incredibly speedy moth last night while Jeremy was on the phone with Joan.  On one hand, I am glad he got his little hunt and was able to devour it as well.  He is quite quick with the claws.  On the other hand, I love moths.  I think they are really pretty and twitchy.  I love how twitchy they are!  Oh well, the cycle of life continues.  So, reaching out to you, hoping you and yours are well.  My thoughts are with you a lot, I can guarantee.  Wishing we could all be next door neighbors...well...maybe some of you should be on the next block over.  ;) Just kidding.  Enjoy October - Libras rock (I'm biased.)  Get Halloween candy even if you don't get trick-or-treaters (more for you!)  Take care. love  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...'round the campfire...  Last night, Jeremy met Corrie and I at our place of business so we could all go out to dinner.  So...we did that!  Then Corrie came home with us and she treated our ears with some music she is going to record for fun.  She strummed the guitar and sang, while Jeremy accompanied her on the mandolin.  After awhile, I joined in singing when they just started playing random songs.  I like to harmonize.  It was so much fun!  I love having live music in the house.  I think it is so important to sing, play musical instruments, and dance.  It can really lift your spirits.   You know what?  I've been purchasing really fun postcards lately.  I hope to actually fill them out and send them on their way to new homes soon.  Of course soon probably means Thanksgiving...I have found some great stores just on my daily walks that sell amazing postcards.  Maybe one will come your way...whoever is out there.  Speaking of walking, Jeremy did the math and discovered that Tuesday through Friday I walk at least 3.5 miles, and the other days, probably only a mile or two.  So how come my tummy isn't shrinking!?  Oh yeah, I like food.  Actually, I do feel healthier in some ways.  Walking is so fantastic.  So many dogs, a crazy-quilt of people, endless asphalt, hole-in-the-wall stores, unpredictable weather... Yeah, so get out there and walk around some.  Oh, and you can send me postcards too if you want.*wink, blush*\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...woo-hoo...  It's working!  It's working!  Oh joy!  Wow, it's been so long my friends.  Unfortunately I decided to try my blog while Jeremy and I are making dinner, so not a lot of time to write.  I promise I will tomorrow night!  Adios.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...this is a test...  Okay, last time I tried a blog entry, it told me something about needing a new folder?!  I have no clue.  So this is a test to see what's going on.  If it works, I will write very soon.  If not...keep checking back with me.  Here we go...\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...net less...  We will be losing internet access for a couple days.  Our year of free access is about to run out, and we just ordered new stuff today, though the disk will take a few days to get here.  So, there may be a semi-long silence, but not too bad.    Oh, I'm feeling a bit better.  I am not working at the Dia today - except for the special gala event tonight - but guess who is working in my place?!  Jeremy!  They may be hiring him for the weekend position we need to fill.  Cross your fingers.    It's odd how quickly moods change...yesterday, I wanted to close my eyes on the world because everything was too painful to look at.  It was so drab outside and also inside me.  Today, even though I am still a little sicky, the world is an okay place, and I am curious about what it has lying in wait for me and others.  Humph...let's see what happens today.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...sigh...  cough, cough.  sniffle.  mmm...tea... that's me right now.  i don't even feel like using capitals.  i am going to work though.   jeremy doesn't think i should, but it's not that bad.  plus...if they see i'm sick today, i can use it to my benefit tomorrow.  i'm very devious.  i just feel blah.  hope you all are well.    \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...hot cross buns...  On Halloween, after I dropped Lola off with her Mama, I was doing my usual walk on 23rd street back to the F stop station.  When I get there, the train is pulling up, so I am rushing to get through the turnstile which keeps telling me I am swiping my card too quickly.  Finally, through the turnstile, and of course the trains doors are shut.  So I plunk my stuff down on a bench, when miraculously the conductor is nice enough to open the doors again!  I dive in, and get settled into a seat.  After a couple moments, I notice a guy sitting on the sideway seats across from me, and it looks like it is Seth, Lola's Dad.  I can only see half of his face, and his wrist tattoo and ring finger are covered up.  Alas, I can't bring myself to say anything.  He gets off at the next stop, never seeing me (and it was him by the way).  This brings me to thinking about awareness and also just invisioning how close we are to people we know and they have no clue.  What I mean,I guess, is those times you realize you've been on the same train as a friend - or what about all those times it happens and neither of you have a clue.  Or just thinking sometimes, wow...there is an apartment somewhere in this mess of a city that contains my husband, and cats, and things.  Or that miles away my Mom is going about her business.   Hmmm...I don't think I am clearly translating my thoughts into words.  I guess it's not a particularly weird phenomenon...sometimes the universe just hits me over the head and it's all very strange.   ...a public service announcement...  Yesterday, Jeremy and I were walking to a little movie theater near our place.  We were approaching the corner right by our house when I became aware of the sizeable group of birds perched on the wires above that particular corner.  I commented about it to Jeremy, and we chatted a little about peolple getting pooped on.  Then we were waiting for the light...under those birds...I looked up...thinking,\"I wonder how often birds poop...\"...I look at the ground and notice all of the stains there.  Right as I think, \"Damn\" and the light changes, I feel something hit my left arm.  That's right, we turned around so I could go change jackets due to the bird poop streaked down my arm - and luckily nowhere else!  Can you believe that!  Needless to say, we did not stand on that corner when we returned...   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...mama don't take my kodachrome away...  Been a long time away from a computer and time.  Holidays were interesting to say the least.  We saw a fair amount of people in Kansas, but not nearly everyone we would have liked to.  Lack of time, transportation, and...well, time.  We did have some memorable ones though, like Ponak's with Cynthia, Ross, and Heather.  The CD Cynthia gave me for Christmas got permanently stuck in Heather's car player...oops!  Bummer for both of us.  Our first night Jer hung out with Johnny and Joe!  Good thing they came inside when they dropped Jer off.  Joe knows good husband/wife relations.   We also made and decorated cookies with our favorite flower girl Anna, her mama, and her awesome aunt and cousins.  Anna was very wired that night, and she gave us amazing gifts she picked out all on her own!  How many almost four year olds would pick out a Bob Marley T for Jeremy because they used to listen to him with Jer when they were a baby!  That same day we saw Kris and Joanna and baby Nora, who is soooo wonderful.  Loni came along for the fun too!  Then there was the get-together that kept growing...Kristen, Becky, Pat, Jenny Bany, Em, Wendy, and Wendy's man.  KB, B, Pat, and JB, and us all went to Sahara first for a lovely meal, then headed to the O.P. branch of the Peanut where we drank, talked, and had a proper adult good time.  Em and all met us there.  Come to find out, Jer used to date Wendy's older sis!  What an odd small world (or just small town)  That night was good.  And of course...last, but most definitely not least...was family time!  We stayed with my Ma, and had some good times, but not nearly as many as we should have.  She really went to town on creating a wonderful Christmas!  We saw Daddad a couple times...it's hard seeing him sooo much older now...every time I visit...we saw Dad, had some dinner with him, hung out...and we actually played with Piper and Nick quite a lot!  Casual Friday...that's all I'm saying.  One reason we got to see them more was our flight back to NY was canceled right as we got to the airport.  Luckily they live up North!  So, we spent an extra night and morning with them.  Unfortunately, I was getting over the stomach bug that attacked me during Christmas Eve night.  We had opened presents already though!  I just wasn't fun to be around, and I passed the bug on to Daddad briefly and Jeremy (he's still getting over it)  Oh!  I also got in a pleasant quick chat with aunt Pat and uncle Gary.  Lovely time had by all. To: Ann, Christine, Evan, Teresa, Hugo, Ana, Jenny O, Matt, Jon, Angie and Thom (well Jer saw you briefly) and everyone else we did not see...we are sorry, and wish we could have seen you all.  We really do miss you and will be back at the end of July.   Please don't hate us :) Oh!  and to Jer's family that we missed seeing because of our flight being canceled same to you.  We love you and are sorry we missed out on fun.   Everyone take care and have a good New Year's.  love...\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...makin' plans stan...  So, no strike thus far.  It is still a possiblity, but who knows what will happen.  Regular work-a-day for moi.  On the other hand...we are filling our schedule in K.C. very quickly.  I know we are going to piss somebody off because we won't be able to see them, but...sorry.  We have no car there, plus we need family time.  We are moving back soon enough anyway.    I'm excited...we are going to decorate the tree when we get back in town.  When I was in high school/college, I was always too busy to dedicate a lot of time to do this, though I loved helping when I was little.  But now, it is exciting again.  My mom said she already put the lights and garlands up, so that leaves the best parts for us!  Ornaments and tinsel.  We have some very unusual ornaments, as well as some normal ones.  There are the various ones that have either my sister or my name on it or our picture.  And of course, the solid colored balls.  But...we also have santa playing tennis (my mom can't stand him!), a little clingy panda, mini stockings that always have fun flavored gum put in them, homemade candy cane reindeer, the gold angels that when my sister was little she ate one of their heads, the totally 70's looking birds (made with brightly colored yarn), southwesty ones, antique-y ones, plastic baby on a cotton ball in half a walnut shell (it's supposed to be baby Jesus - I made it in preschool), and best of all the gold, green, magenta, silver glittery pointy thing that for some reason reminds me of the Kremlin that goes on top of the tree. Oh!  Don't forget the bubble lights!   I love our tree.  It has so much going on... \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...(chanting) strike,strike,strike,strike...  There may be a transit strike in New York within a couple of days.  I have mixed emotions about this.  I definitely want workers to strike if a deal is not made, because everyone should be making good wages, plus the MTA are a bunch of scammers who apparently have no money currently, yet people riding public transportation is way up.  Money mismanagement?  Most likely.  Plus a strike will create an interesting situation that I secretly desire to be played out so I may watch and kind of participate in.   On the other hand...so many people rely on public transportation, and it's going to get ugly out there with extra-huge traffic jams, even pissier people (which I cannot handle), and who knows what else.  Such a delicate balance...So...to strike or not to strike?  You gotta do what you gotta do.  I don't think I will personally be troubled much if it happens.  As long as we can make it to the airport Wednesday in a timely manner (cross your fingers for no delays and great weather!) Oh!  Another thing...the news has totally been hyping up how horrible this will be and even dragged in the 'ol terroism plea (that this would be a perfect opportunity for it)  It seems like someone is maybe in bed with the MTA and trying to scare those transit workers...Also...the union leader is very cool.  That's all.   ...lament for counter space and time...  I wish I had a kitchen with lots of counter space and cubbies to store things.  I would be able to unbox my AWESOME mixer and quisinart, as well as use our other fun gadgets in a much easier fashion than we can now.  And I wish for time in order to make the things I have dreaming of making recently...my great-Grandma Birdie's (passed to me from my Grandma) Swedish pecans, Fafa's (my Mom's Mom's father) caramels, a very belated super-chocolately birthday cake for Jeremy,  biscuits of all kinds, pies out the wazoo, and all those other glorious baked goods that Martha Stewart wants me to make...Sigh.  Soon...first we gotta clean those dishes...   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...the rush...  Saturday morning I ventured out to the Union Square holiday market/farmer's market.  I spent most of my time at the latter.  I purchased a cup of hot spiced grape juice (so good!) to warm my hands.  There were potatoes of all kinds, knobby carrots, fresh herbs, wintery veggies, fresh eggs, goat cheese, farmer's cheese, jams, jellies, and pickles, and mountains of baked goods.  The smells were overwhelming.  I love just walking around farmer's markets.    We leave for Kansas City a week from this Wednesday!  Home...well, one of them.  This time of year always seems to fly by easier than the rest.  Lots of diversions I guess.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...are these those times...  Isn't it amazing that a simple CD can bring back such a rush of times, happy times, but now it just makes you almost kind of sad...I am alone in my apartment in Brooklyn on a Tuesday night, my feet are freezing regardless of how much blanket I wrap around them, and all I can think of listening to this music are friends who are no longer a part of my daily or even semi-daily routine.  We are still friends...things just get busy, and no one lives nearby anymore...will this change when we move back to Kansas City?  Or will I just long for Adam Kuban to leave a kooky message, or to see Corrie B at work, and to hang out with Adam and Angela, or to eat Chinese food with Bea?  Don't get me wrong...even though I get wistful at times, I love now.  I wouldn't trade any of my time with Jeremy for all the candy, or mixed tapes, or other great things in the world.  He is so...sigh.(good sigh)  So, I am enjoying my time here as much as possible.  I've been worrying too much lately.  I forget that that has not worked for me in the past, so why should I bother to let it gain force now.  My biggest concern for tomorrow...find my mittens, because my hands damn near froze today!  That cold reached right into my teeth and shook all the way through every bone.  It's sneaky, that cold.  Wow...the CDs just switched (from Tori to Tool!)  Now I am in high school, in my room, painting my sandals and whatever else I can get my hands on.  A cup of tea, my own phone line, incense, a stereo...or it could be me now, considering I still listen to Tool all the time!  Yay...Jeremy walked in from tunin' class.  Screw you guys!  Just kidding...  can you believe his classes are over next Tuesday?  Maybe you didn't even know that...or maybe... I'm a total freak!  Alright, sorry to leave you for my man, but he's distracting and I like to hang out with him.  Adios. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...watching...

Our Thanksgiving trek was great.  It was nice to get away even if for a couple of days.  Joan had her veggie lasagna just coming out of the oven when we arrived on Wednesday night.  So, we had a nice dinner, and just hung out.  Rachel and I had a fun time painting nails and chatting.  Thursday, we drove to Meade, Alan, Lucas, and Liam's farm in South Haven.  Ahhhh.  An invigorating walk and talk, good food, board games, no responsibilities.  Jeremy and I spent the night at their place, while Joan and Rachel stayed in town.  In the morning, I helped Alan take one of the cars in to town for a tune up.  Then we made our way back, and Alan whipped up his wonderful blueberry waffles.  Unfortunately, we had to leave after that to go back to Detroit, but it was the first night of Hanukkah, so Joan made latkes and applesauce (with ginger in it!) and we ate some leftovers too.  We exchanged prensents and played dreidel, which is a fun game (especially if the dreidel isn't rigged.)  So...there's a lot to be thankful for.  Thanks to all my new family...I love you all very much...and thanks to all my own family...you know I love you tons as well.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...restless night...  I kept tossing and flopping all night...much of it due to strange dreams.  Here is the last one I had before waking up for good. I was on my Mom's street(in front of the house, but more to the left) and had just run into Lola who wanted to have the stuffed animal I was holding.  We were discussing the topic when I see Nancy (our upstairs neighbor in NY) in a very decadent wedding dress walking across the street, headed to my old elementary school, Brookridge, which is right around the corner.  She shouts something at me, but I don't quite hear.  All this time I am thinking, \"She and Rich are getting married?...but we never got an invitation.\"  She leaves her Manolo Blahnik shoes on the corner of 99th and Lowell, and I get the impression that she wants me to bring them when I come to the wedding.  I drop the stuffed animal, and run across the street to pick up the shoes, and go to find what is going on.  I finally get to the school (which is seriously a short block from my Mom's house) and inside everyone is dressed up, milling about, and I don't see Nancy.  I do however see my mother and my sister all prepped for the event.  I am in jeans and a t-shirt.  Someone tries to hand me a flower petal, but I tell them I'll get one when I come back.  I go to my sister and tell her Jeremy and I never got our invitation.  She says she is sure we are invited, and talks about how Nancy talked the whole month of April to her about it.  I ask if I have enough time to change and she says I have plenty.  I run home, but it is that special slow-motion dream running.  Finally I make it to my Mom's and run up to my old bedroom.  I already knew that I would just throw on the flower dress that I wore to Piper's college graduation.  Jeremy wasn't even home yet from the doctor.  I reach into the closet, pull out the dress, turn around, then look down as I am taking my clothes off and see that I already had on a white eyelet dress.  I take it off and am turning the dress around because it was inside-out, when Jeremy comes home.  I tell him what's going on and he gets wide eyed.  A few seconds later he appears almost fully dressed, while I am pulling my dress on still!  I also realize that the flower dress turned into a velvety number that I have never seen, but is beautiful.  While I am pulling it on, he tells me about his doctor's visit (which I will not go into details here, because it is too strange)  Then I woke up...  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...how it is...  Salt scars run along the sidewalks like seams to some huge, unknown sewing project.  It also seems that as quickly as dogs can let it come out, what does instantly freezes to the asphalt.  Halos of this seasons past eliminations are everywhere you can look.  It is hard to escape much of anything here.  I keep dreaming of those steaming, summer-y, so-hot-it's-painful sidewalks that are coming up in the future.  The city starts to sweat and all the smells come out intensified by the dense air.  Sigh.  I'm already at that point in the winter where I need sunlight warming my naked arms, sweat slowly rolling down my side, and a good porch where I can watch the world go by, then dive in.  This usually does not come until February... Hoping all of you are able to stay inside under blankets, with warm drinks and a nice companion (person, book, pet, or otherwise)...but if not, that you can think warm thoughts while walking those bitter sidewalks.  love.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...snow day...  I wish that the few inches of snow on the ground would render the city useless and make it so I wasn't able to go to work.  Snow day!  It's been so long since the days of school snow days.  We even got them a couple times in college...of course, they told us once we were halfway through the day anyway, so it wasn't as satisfactory.  Most of us decided to stay in studio anyway.  At least today is a go-home-early day.  I do not have to pick up Miss Lola.  I get to come home and...do laundry!  Woo-hoo!  Friday's are sizzlin'!   ...the little things...  the day where there were hundreds of oil rainbows in the street, running into someone familiar on the train, how frank always has kitty kisses for you, unexpected mail from friends, coming home to find my husband walking towards me with a big glass of juice and dinner on its way, looking through sara's cedar chest, having the big, blind dog run into me on the street and apologizing to it, being comforted by the fact that the weeds are growing up through the tracks at the smith and 9th stop, watching a shadow bird walk the length of a rusty i-beam, the beauty of viewing a plane glistening in the morning sunlight through the industrial structure of our subway station, being privy to secrets (positive ones) and i'm not even going to tell you, the joy of hot cocoa in a tiny cup...\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...so many words, so little time...  I have not felt like writing recently, because I have been absolutely glued to other activities.  Jeremy even has a hard time pulling me away from my books and drawing.  It feels good though.  There is generally a bone biting cold outside, so I try not to go unless I must.  Today, I must brave it to pick up the little mama, but then I get to meet Corrie, Christine, and Jeremy for my first Ethiopian feast!  Yummmm...well, I hope...I don't know what it will taste like yet!  So...life is pretty good.  Jeremy is making blintzes and coffee for breaklunch as I write, the roaches are on retreat from our apartment, we are healthy, Jeremy is making business contacts, I am surrounded by things that need my attention, we have been cooking a lot, etc.  Yes...\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...it is not acceptable for a mermaid to turn into a panda...  My hands are itching to work out some ideas.  Why have I kept myself from drawing for so long?!  I guess I doodle some.  Anyway...Piper and Nick gave me a great blank book for Christmas, so I believe that tomorrow, or possibly this evening, I shall start filling it with things I like to look at whether it be other people's visuals, my own, or writing.  Very exciting.  I'll have to pull myself away from my new books though.  With my gift card bonus from work I purchased Fast Food Nation and Gangs of New York in person, and am reading them simultaneously.  Excellent.  I finished out the card last night on-line with The Grey Lady and the Strawberry Snatcher,  The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss, and the latest Dead Prez CD. I've seen two new movies within the last week: Gangs of New York and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  Gangs was great.  I am absolutely fascinated with that period in time.  Very violent movie, but great.  I am a total nerd who now wants to go find where the five-points neighborhood used to be.  Harry Potter was good as well.  Maybe a little scary for kids, but probably not.  I was into crazy, mythic beasties at a young age, as well as low-grade horror films, and look...I'm normal...hmmm.                                                                                                               You know what I miss?  Crows.  I don't think the city has much visible besides pigeons and sparrows.  Sadly in K.C. they have so many crows that they place poison on top of buildings for them to ingest.  That's bad news bears.  I love large birds.  We had a badge in Campfire called the Thunderbird.  I think you had to stand out in the rain for 20 minutes or something to earn it (that's a very bizarre thing to have to do to earn a badge)  Anyway, I hoped more than anything that I would see an actual thunderbird someday.  Why am I never the person who sees the things I always read about starting in fourth grade from those books on the supernatural/myths/strange natural things shelf in the library at school?  I guess I should not complain...I have experienced some very \"strange\" (though they didn't feel wrong) things with energy and such.  Uh-oh...I'm getting all space-y on ya.  Yeah, so no crows here.  Maybe if I set out some shiny things they will come...\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...encounters...  What a hectic, odd, strangely beautiful at times week it has been.  Things at both jobs were fritzy - mass mail orders + other stuff, kids with flu and double ear infections.  Plus I had a few encounters on the street that took me by surprise.  One day I was headed to Lola's school and noticed a man walking towards me with two crutches.  When we were about ten feet apart he suddenly yells, \"Hey, don't step in that!\"  I instantly freeze, one foot suspended above the sidewalk and do a quick frontal scan, find nothing, so check in back thinking I may have already stepped in it.  There is nothing there as well.  Right as I realize this he says with a big smile,\"Quit thinking so hard!  Relax!\"  I did not say anything and we both kept on walking.  About twenty paces afterwards I decided I should have said thanks...or at least smiled.  The next day...I was just crossing 10th Ave. on 22nd Street right by the Dia when a man carrying a paper bag walks up saying, \"Sock, hats, gloves.\"  Seeing as how I generally ignore people selling things on the street and already was wearing all three of the things he was selling with plenty more at home, I just kept walking.  He immediately said, \"Alright, f**k n*****s.\" like that was what I was thinking.  That certainly woke me up.  Again, I said nothing and kept walking.  Part of me wishes I had turned around and said,\"Actually I don't need any of those things and it's not because you're African-American and I'm white.  It's because I don't need them!!\" but the other part just thought that I really don't feel like getting into a debate this early in the morning when all I want to do is get to work, eat my bagel and drink a little joe.  Did I do the right thing, who knows, ah well.  I wish people would get to know me before they decide who I am. (I was just reading this again and I thought I should add that it's not always other people who do this...I know I have done it myself...what makes us do it, I cannot say) Well...we all have our things. I saw this dog I have seen before again.  This time at the Union Square dog park instead of tied up in front of the Garden of Eden grocery store on 23rd.  It's the tough looking black and white, kind of pit-bully or Spud's McKenzie type face, but in this humorously large green and ecru sweater!  The first time I saw him I burst out laughing.  And there he was again.  I love running into the same people or animals throughout my days.  I guess it's easy to when you have the same route daily, but often it is not even related to that.  Who knew in a city of this size! So...my dear friend Kristen who I have known since middle school is in a car at this moment, in New Jersey, headed for Brooklyn.  She has Ben with her (who we have not met) and they are here for five days or so!  Kristen is great.  She hasn't been to New York since we went on a theater trip here our senior year.  Fun!  She's a good gal to travel with.  It was her, Heather, and I (or is it me) who went to Australia together.  Hmmm...I suppose I should help Jer finish last minute cleaning...\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...what i do when i am alone...

Did I ever tell you the one about the skinwalker I saw?  I know I probably have...but here it goes again.  We were driving on a single lane highway, twisting through the cold, New Mexico night.  Mike was driving, I was the passenger, and Dave was in the back.  We were talking about what nights such as that inspire you to.  I would periodically gaze out the side window, trying to make out the desert plants stretching on forever.  On one of those looks, I saw a flash, though a very clear one, of a very tall creature, almost all black except for a white head.  It's arms were so long that they reached the ground.  It used them to lope along at an incredible pace - keeping up with the car.  This was only maybe ten feet away from our car.  I looked away, then back, and it was gone.  I rushed to tell the others, but they just thought I was being dramatic, or letting the scenery take my imagination on a ride.  When we stopped for the night, I quickly sketched out a little drawing of what I saw... Months later (that was in March - now we are in September) at school we had a visiting artist who did these performances on stilts, stilts for both her legs and arms.  She wore animal print material all over, and the stilts made her lope strangely.  I saw her perform in the streets during the Westport Art Fair.  I took pictures.  It reminded me of what I saw...I told some people the story, but they thought I was strange. A few more months go by and the pictures are developed.  I took them over to my sister's to show her, plus tell her the story.  She was wide eyed, then told me she teaches a story of Native American (Navajo I think) origin in which they talk about creatures similar to what I described, called Skinwalkers.  Little kids in the Southwest will hear them on the roof-tops trying to get in.  Actually, one of her friends who lived in New Mexico saw one too.  I felt...relieved that someone believed me and that I had really seen what I had seen.  I was also slightly freaked out, but not really.   I don't know what inspired me to write this today.  The mood just caught me I guess.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...snow dunes...

So...I'm not sure if I feel like re-writing it now or not.  Here's the un-exciting run-down.  Lots of snow. Huge dunes. Very happy...bouncing off walls.  Staying indoors, coffee, photographs, buried cars, snow...Peace rally on Saturday - wonderful experience, lots of people, puppets and signs, freezing toes, people united all over the world, police blocking us once we came from 2nd to Lex so Jer could leave, home, hope it works.  Ah well...that's it in cave-man language.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...i'm free...  Singin' a song, la la la, my Mondays are free!  Another day to dream, draw, hang out, enjoy leasurely coffee mornings and write.  I think I have the most ideal living in New York work schedule now.  There is absolutely no reason to be in a bad mood about anything!    \"Quilts contain volumes of cultural information about the times in which they were created and the circumstances in which they were used.  Each one can tell us about the lives of the people associated with it.\" - from History from the Heart - E.Duane Elbert & Rachel Kamm Elbert Tiny voiced Sara and I went to the Whitney on Saturday primarily to view the show on the quilts of Gee's Bend, Alabama.  They are great!  All the materials are from old clothes, leftover courdoroy scraps from when the women were hired by Sears and Roebuck in the 70s to make pillows, and any scrounged fabric imaginable whether stained or not.  I saw one that had pieces from those classic, cheap (i.e. dorm mattresses) blue-striped mattresses!  There were even rust traces on it.  Beautiful.  In the documentary they showed of the women, they would occassionally comment on how their quilts were not like those fancy quilts you see...their's are not perfects squares with elegant top stitching, and store-bought fabrics or even always traditional patterns.  I think both kinds are wonderful.  Quilts can be anything!  Make them however you want!   So...that show was excellent, as was the stuff from the Whitney's permanent collection that was on display.  I was surprised every time I rounded a corner.  The best part is that working at the Dia we get a card that gets us into any museum (not just art) in all bouroughs for free!  Plus we can bring a guest for free too!  Woo-hoo!  I want to take full advantage of that and I will!  I can't believe I have been so lacadasical (spelling?) about getting out-and-about!  So...I have been having a lot of political talks lately, as I am sure many people have been.  I am discovering more and more that most people are against what is going on.  Even my Mom is...not that she is normally pro-war at all, but most of the time she doesn't really take much of a stance, plus she is a registered Republican and votes as such.  She is much more like the old Kansas Republicans though, who actually weren't super-right, plus cared about funding education, etc.  I think this is going to be about the only time I address any of this on this site.  I like to keep this as a place of the little details in life, and things that are ultimately good (at least for me.)  So...in case you are wondering why this is a place that seems to not care about the state of the world, that is why (not that I think anyone who may read this is thinking that.)    Hmmm...I feel like I want to write more, but I'm not sure what about...it's probably best to quit for now.  Hoping all is well...  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...sweet tooth...  I have been thinking a lot about sweets lately.  I had this whole, ambitious plan that for around Valentine's day I was going to make truffles, as well as homemade caramels and Swedish pecans.  This, of course, will probably not happen, or at least won't happen within the next week or so as things tend to go with me.  I thought, though, that I might share the recipe for Swedish pecans with you, as they are extremely tasty and remind me of my Grandmother.  It's actually my Great-Grandma Birdie's recipe (who knows where she got it) but I remember them filling the various candy dishes scattered around my Grandparent's apartment at special times of the year.  Here ya go:  4 cups pecan halves in warm 300 degree oven for 10 min.  2 egg whites, 1/8 tsp. salt, 1 cup sugar...beat sugar into whites...add cinnamon and/or vanilla and rum flavoring- 1tsp. each  Mix warm pecans in egg mixture.  Separately, melt 1 stick butter.  Cover large cookie sheet with half of the butter.  Arrange nuts on sheet.  Pour remaining butter over. Bake 30 min. at 300 degrees, turning nuts with a spatula every 10 min.  Yum! Yum!  Enjoy...feel free to share yummy recipes with me too!  I'm always on the look-out.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...it's nice to see you without your hat on...  The weather outside has been great the last few days.  On Saturday, I was walking home from the co-op and the skies were grey, but it wasn't too cold out.  The air was really moist, like it should have been at least misting, but it wasn't.  Every breath dragged in wet, salty air that coated your throat.  I loved it...I started breathing deeper so I wouldn't stop feeling that sensation.  Here, I don't normally notice the salt in the air.  There were even seagulls on fifth avenue (in Brooklyn)!  Every ocean experience came back to me and I just floated in them until I reached home.  What a wonderful walk.  Yesterday it was pretty nice out, but I was inside the Dia all day, so it did not matter as much.  I was feeling pretty frisky in my new Murakami t-shirt, though, so I had to dance around some and get the wiggles out since I could not be outside.  Today we got to meet Joan (in town for just today) and Judy for lunch in mid-town before I picked up the Lola.  It was very pleasant.  We ate at a little Italian cafe and enjoyed our brief time together.  Outside the weather was...so great you didn't even need a hat.  People were out, and actually smiling.  Even though it is still cold, there is that hope of Spring...the cold cannot last.  Thank heavens for that.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...the beauty of wind rippling through grass...  Jeremy and I went to see Spirited Away this afternoon seeing as how we missed it the first time it was in theaters.  Japanese animation (in particular Miyazaki) is delightful!  Incredibly beautiful!  Makes me want to cry and laugh and sigh!  I love it now, and I know I would have loved it as a child.    \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...smelled any good houses lately?...  As I settled into my seat on the A train this morning, I noticed the smell of boring soup permeating the whole car.  I could not tell if it was coming from someone in particular, or if it is just what that section of the train smelled like.  It made me think of how everyone's houses have different over-all odors.  Many houses are fairly benign, but others are extremely distinct.  That always fascinated me as a kid...I can't really describe my Mom's house as it was fairly mellow most of the time, but when she cooked fish...All I know is that I was getting picked up in high school one night by some friends to go to a show at school and I did not escape before she began cooking.  It was fairly horrifying.   So it goes...that's better than the litter box stench I am marinating in right now!  The glories of trash night.  As we emerged from the Carrol Street stop, the train rickety-rackety-ing it's way to Smith and 9th, I discovered that while I had been underground half of the sky was that perfect shade of storm blue that looks even more fantastic with lightning streaking across.  It gave me the power to feel as if I had summoned this storm and was in control of the wind.  Every third molecule of air had a bite to it.  Luckily I had Arizona scarf wrapped around me.  I need a bit of the West these days.  Torn between directions...why do all the landscapes have to be so good?!  So now Jeremy is my hero and buying us tortilla chips and glorious fake cheese sauce so we can have a night of bean dip, avocado, electric cheese, and salad.  Plus, he rented a movie!  Plus, he is my favorite person to hang out with!  It is a good night after a fine, but whatever day.            \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...you look like a child and smell like a child...  Above...this is what Lola said to me yesterday.  Interesting.  Is this a good thing?  I suppose!  The birds have been chasing each other around (look at the nest I built you...halt! check out my nest!)  and everyone here in the city seems a bit happier as well as a little more loopy.  I've seen many people with these disturbing, vacant eyes just walking down the street or standing on the subway while doing these bizarre smiles that go in and out.  It's not even day-dreamy looking, it's just kind of creepy.  Ah well.      \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...where do you come from?...  Lying on the stairs coming up from the F platform at the 2nd Avenue stop is a small, black button with a piece of thread for a tail.  Whose jacket is missing you, or do you come from pants...perhaps a shirt.  Will they even notice you are gone?  Will someone new pick you up?  Maybe I should have, but I was surrounded by people when I noticed you.  You remind me of my many clothes that are missing buttons...  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...breathe...  Today I am calm.  I am centered.  I am ready for what the world has to offer on a global level as well as a personal one.  Things are better because the weather has turned, it is light when I get off of work, I don't have to wear a coat, and the air (even in New York) smells fantastic!     \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...we are a peaceful people?!...  Uh, yeah...I must have forgotten how peaceful Americans or any other humans are.  Excuse me while I go take a shower to rid myself of all the disgusting things my ears just took in listening to the president speak.  I like to believe deep inside my core that humans are good, beautiful beings as are all other creatures...and I do come across things that reinforce this every day, but man...on the other hand...\"Humans are a bad animal.\"  This doesn't even come down to an American people issue with me (though I do not agree with many of our leaders) I think all people have that potential to be total hateful, greedy war monkeys.  But...we can stop ourselves at any time.  It frustrates me how many people there are in the world, how out-of-control this experiment, this life has gotten, but at the same time...that is what happens.  \"Things fall apart, the center cannot hold...\"  What do we do?  More, more, more. What else can we do?  Who is 'right'?  What is 'right'?  The right certainly doesn't have the answers, and I'm pretty sure the left doesn't have them either.  So many differing opinions of what is 'good' and what is 'bad'.  Who truly has the authority to say?  I don't.  Just because you are in a position of power and control does not mean that you do not die at some point like the rest of us.  And that is the beauty...the unknown...of what is to happen here in our earthly lives and what happens when that no longer exists.  So...what will I do?  What will you do?  I could really use a hug right now...I think the whole world could.  Peace.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...the weekend approacheth...  I absolutely adore Fridays!  No one is allowed to be in a bad mood...at least I'm never allowed!  I never feel like it.  They are somehow always sunnier, put a little more skip in your step.  Work should be good...Christine is usually hyper and will jump around with me or play bumper cars with the big roll-y cushions we have (uhh...we only do it on Sundays though!...no boss!)  Ron is there and makes you just want to stand around and talk.  Rich is usually goofy.  Michelle is in a good mood.  And Lola is always good on Fridays because if she has all of her stars for the week she gets a small toy!  Then, Jeremy is cooking an Indian feast tonight!  I finally found a store that sells the onion relish that I ADORE and can endlessly eat.  So...bought a container - fresh- bought some nan...have the simmer sauce of a saag persuasion waiting for some veggies and tofu to be added.  Have the frozen samosa and the lovely onion relish, tamarind sauce, and mango chutney to be poured liberally on whatever it calls for.  Mmmm...then it's printmaking time!  Joy.  Hope your Fridays are filled with fun people and good food as well. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...music for my eyes...  I bought a book of Michael Ondaatje's (the author who wrote \"The English Patient\") poetry entitled \"The Cinnamon Peeler.\"  What a joy it is to soak in this book!  So beautiful.  I thought I would share with you one of my favorites so far...  Near Elginburg  3 a.m. on the floor mattress. In my pyjamas a moth beats frantic my heart is breaking loose.  I have been dreaming of a man who places honey on his forehead before sleep so insects come tempted by liquid to sip past it into the brain. In the morning his head contains wings and the soft skeletons of wasp.  Our suicide into nature. That man's seduction so he can beat the itch against the floor and give in move among the sad remnants of those we have destroyed, the torn code these animals ride to death on. Grey fly on windowsill white fish by the dock, heaved like a slimy bottle into the deep, to end up as snake heckled by children and cameras as he crosses lawns of civilization.  We lie on the floor mattress lost moths walk on us waterhole of flesh, want this humiliation under the moon. Till in the morning we are surrounded by dark virtuous ships sent by the kingdom of the loon.  -Michael Ondaatje  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...came to an end, found a new beginning...  I had to say goodbye to Kristen (and Ben-who is very nice) this morning.  It was sad...I enjoyed going out and doing stuff with them, but mainly the times we just got to hang out and talk, or make stuff (her knitting me drawing) or dance or cook or tickle.  I'm glad she is going to where she is though.  She is moving to West Virginia to small-scale farm.  Yay! So, this morning it was lightly raining on my whole journey to work.  It was fairly warm out and just a little drizzly.  I spent most of my time at the Dia today in the back entering on the web, so I did not know it had stopped till I broke for a roof-top coffee break.  By the time I left at two, the day had turned a brilliant shade of sun striking through slightly grey, but mainly bright blue skies.  I stuffed my hat, mittens and two scarves in my bag and enjoyed having my head exposed to the air.  The weather today made me stand a little taller, walk with a more relaxed gait, and hold my head up - making eye contact and smiling a lot.  I also looked up, up, up at the buildings I was walking by.   You'd be surprised how much good stuff you can miss if you are always looking down or at eye level.  My back and temperment were glad to take a sunny stretch and realize that things are not so wrong.  There were lots of good smells on the street as well...lentil soup, laundry room air, honey roasted nuts, a city scrubbed a little more clean by the rains.                                                         \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...ebay binge...  I formed a very bad habit today, but luckily I have restricted it to today.  Right now I have three packages from various ebay seller headed my way.  All were cheap (the most expensive being $35 w/shipping)  and they should be good...One is a set of 8 National Geographic magazines from 1935, one of which is for June.  In the June issue is a picture of my Grandmother as a bridesmaid for a West Point wedding.  People actually used to recognize her from it due to her flaming red hair!!  Another package contains Pee-Wee Herman trading cards, tatoos, stickers, and masks.  Fun!  And last but not least is a package of Victorian era (though a fair amount actually is not of that time) papers - maps, books, pamphlets, certificates, ration books, post cards...plus, coins, a letter opener made of bone, sugar tongs and a few other bizarre things.  Surprise!  That's it for me...at least for now.  No more till we have a house!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...all is well...  The weekend was great, and the days I have been back have been that way as well.  I got to hang out with Daddad a lot and the rest of my family, sling back $2 margaritas with Jenny, eat lots of Mexican food, talk with a bank about getting pre-approved for a home mortgage, and lots more.    Being back is good.  I missed Jeremy a lot!  Things are good...plans are known and yet unknown too.  I am not very worried about whatever future we have.  It's good to have warm weather here, and thunderstorms!, and healthy cats, and...everything.    \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...happy birthday to you...  Today my Daddad (my Mom's father), Thomas Lyman French,Jr., turns 91.  He is the reason I am going back to Kansas City tomorrow for an extended weekend.  Now...Daddad is not a perfect man.  He has some characteristics I do not agree with, but those certainly do not make up most of who he is.  I love him very dearly.  When my Mama (his wife) died when I was in fourth grade, he started coming to our house for a visit every afternoon.  I have grown very close to him over the years.  Daddad grew up in San Antonio, Texas with his parents and his four siblings : Olive, Claude, Dorothy, and James.  All of them have passed away.  He had a very accident-filled childhood.  For example:  he was nearly scalped when he got in a bicycle accident.  They took him to the pharmacist who poured peroxide on his skull while sitting at the soda counter.  There was also the time his brother was swinging around a box of dirt on a rope (who knows why- it was the 1920s?!) and when their father told him to quit it he just let go and it smacked Daddad in the head.  Then one time he was riding on the outside of a Model T, headed to play football with some friends, when the car tipped and fell on top of him.  They just erected it, played football, then Daddad got his leg checked out.  His father died about a month before the depression, but luckily left coins in the safety deposit box.  My great-grandmother Georgia did people's laundry, Daddad worked, and they took out some coins each month.  He worked at an ice-cream factory for awhile, which is appropriate considering he is one of the biggest chocolate fiends I have ever met!  I used to open cabinets in his kitchen and find them lined with one-pound Hershey bars!  Part of that is he still has a depression mentality (the man saves everything), but mostly it's because he eats unearthly amounts of chocolate!  Anyway...Georgia died young as well.  My Daddad always gets teary-eyed when he talks about how she had to cut her hair (it was red and when it was down, trailed behind her on the ground!) because it caused too much pain.  So, Daddad moved to Kansas City due to his job and met my Mama, Marjorie Jane Benton.  He spotted her having a soda with some friends after a bible class, strolled up, swung one of his long legs over a chair, sitting in it backwards, and said, \"Howdy girls, my name is Tex.\"  He asked her out soon after, and thirteen days after their first date, they were engaged.  They got married a few months after that.  Daddad left to fight in World War II.  He was in the military police and saw lots of things in Europe, and met some very interesting people.  My mother was born while he was away...he did not see her until she was seven or so months old.  When he returned, he worked for the IRS investigating people who wanted to work for the IRS.  This is why he is a notorious questioner of everything!  He has never tasted coffee in his life, though he enjoys a nice, cold Coke.  He hasn't had a drink since Mama got sick.  She, and in turn he, were very social people in their day.  Never been a smoker.  Has had some fairly major health problems, but is still going.  He gets sad that he can't recall things well...he is a story-teller, so it hurts extra.  He has traveled the world - Europe, both during the war and later on with Mama, Africa, Mexico, the U.S.  They were planning to go to Australia, but then she got sick...There is so much more...  Daddad has instilled in me a love of family- living and past, history, collecting (you should see his stamp collection!), not to be too extravagent and to share what you have, work hard, be educated,and so much more.  I realize that this could be his last birthday...that's why I knew I had to fly home.  He and I are very close...he told my Mom, \"I can't believe she is coming just for me!\"  He is my last grandparent.  They were all so important to me, and I can't bear to think of having to let go again, but I know that's how things go.  I don't think he's scared and I am not for him, or for what I will feel.  But...this is a celebration of someone who is luckily still here despite all those head traumas at a young age!  Here's to you Daddad! (even though he won't read this...he's not into computers) Happy Birthday and I will see you on Saturday.  I love you.  xoxo\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...we have taken over...  Psst!...This is Frank and Bones!  We can't believe Stacy forgot to mention our part in this past weekend!  She was just focused on her fancy highlighting tricks.  Humph!  We had a splendid few days with that little human they referred to as Morgan.  Finally, someone actually paid close attention to us and played with us endlessly.  She discovered our love of the rainbow wand and the octopus-on-a-string immediately.  I, Frank, delighted in her presence from the get go, but you know Bones...he takes a bit to warm up to things.   Hey!  This is Bones (aka Boney Mahoney, Bones Muldoon, purr-bot, and whatever else they think to call me) Alright, alright...I'm just a little shy.  I still had a lot of napping on the box by the heater to get in before I was really interested in Morgan.  But she's a great kid.  Top notch.  We are so bored now that she is gone.  She would even move my scratching post to wherever I was!  Now, that is service!  I mean...don't get me wrong...Stacy and Jeremy are pretty good humans, but it's always in and out, squirting us when we just want to sharpen our claws on their stuff, and not as much play as we require...though they do feed us well, and provide excellent napping opportunities.   Oh!  Uh...we gotta go!  I hear Stacy coming and we can't let her discover yet we know how to type!  Meow!   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...success declared...  I entered my apartment building after work on Thursday and was greeted by Zoe, my favorite New York dog, as usual.  After a couple good pets, I threw open the door finally able to do what I had been waiting for all day...to see  urlLink Josh  and meet  urlLink Julie  and Morgan!  (By the way, Julie taught me how to do that word highlight-y thing within my text!  Now you know how totally un-computer saavy I am.  Thanks Julie.)  We had a great night.  Julie and Josh are a very excellent match for each other (aw...cute and nice!) and Morgan instantly endeared herself to me by saying, \"I hear you are artsy-fartsy like me!\"  Jeremy and I even got to sign her coveted Dr. Suess My Book About Me.  We  drew, had make your own tacos, and then after Morgan was asleep had adult hang-out/talk time.  Not the dirty meaning of \"adult\" okay!   On Friday I had to go to work, but only until two, so they all came to meet me so we could head to the Natural History Museum.  I had never been there before, and man...that place is big!  We didn't even see half of it, and we saw tons.  Jeremy kept harassing Morgan by poking her with an umbrella , so she finally got him back when we were sitting in front of the stuffed penguins.  Thus, the umbrella fights began.  We went to  urlLink Guru  for dinner, which is where Jer and I had our N.Y. wedding reception last summer.  I watched Morgan work on the same spoonful of lentil doughnut in yogurt sauce for about fifteen minutes.  She whispered, \"It's kind of sour!\"  Not one complaint though, and she did eat some as well as portions of what Josh and Julie had.  We headed home and ended the long day early.   Saturday was the big day, the reason we were all gathered...Joan's birthday celebration!  Josh left in the morning to go to New Jersey originally to pick up Rick, though unfortunately he was not able to come, but got to hang out with him instead.  We just kicked around the apartment, watching Simpson's episodes, eating breakfast, getting ready, goofing around.  I was very mean and kept picking up Morgan and messing with her, trying to get her to wake up and play with me.  Finally she did when Julie brought her breakfast.  I apologized for bugging her and she said that was okay.  Man...she is the most sweet, polite kid!  Wait...I know lots of great kids...I'm not going to play favorites!  So, Joan's party was a success.  Everyone seemed to have a great time.  Food was tasty and plentiful, it was beautiful outside, family and friends were gathered, and there were lots of people to meet and lots of folks who had not seen each other in a long time.  It was sad when we had to say goodbye to Josh, Julie and Morgan in front of the restaurant.  Morgan started crying and it broke Jeremy and I's hearts. Jer and I wished that we could all live in the same town.  We miss hanging out with Josh, and now we miss the latest additions to the family.  It's nice to think about how it is just a beginning though, and not an ending.    Jeremy and I hopped in a cab with Rachel and Judie to head on to Grandma Bea's.  There, we got to relax and watch Joan open her presents!  I always love seeing what people pick out for others.  Joan seemed very pleased with the whole day.  We were happy to be surrounded by so much family!  I got to hang out more with Rachel, which is always a good time, and eventually Peter and Joanne, followed closely by Chris and Juhani with their new girlfriends Carlin and Rebecca, showed up.  After lots of gabbing, suddenly it was around 8:30!  Time raced by on Saturday.  We all walked out together, but then Peter and Joanne caught a cab.    So...Chris, Carlin, Juhani, Rebecca, Jeremy and I all headed for Chris's car which was parked a ways away.  Lots of laughing and getting to know one another.  When we made it to the car, Chris folded up the backseat so that four of us could sit Native-American style (the preferred nomenclature) back there while he and Carlin had the luxurious front seats.  It gave me a new perspective on how scary drivers in New York are.  We went all the way uptown to where Peter and Joanne live (81st Street!) By the end, Juhani and I were clinging on for dear life and trying not to hurl.  (Chris is a very good driver, but was giving us a hard time!)  We were very grateful when he let us out, our legs buckling beneath us.  We decided not to go up to Peter and Joanne's, but went instead to a good Mexican place around the corner where we had a very delayed dinner and drinks.  Mmm...strawberry margaritas...so tasty and alcohol ladden...After many laughs, stories and such Jeremy and I called it a night and found the nearest subway.  We made it home around 1:45 am and went to bed almost immediately (We first had to make sure our neighbor Nancy upstairs wasn't dead like we thought she may be, but that is a whole other story!)  So, the long day was done.  We were tired, happy, and still a little sad, but we had a great weekend.  Thanks to all who were involved.  Oh...Julie...sorry we never got a  urlLink Manhattan Special.  (I just wanted another excuse to use the highlight-y thing!)  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...funny tails...  On Friday Lola and I did our usual perusing of the Union Square Farmer's Market and obtained a couple of chocolate chip cookies.  We plopped down on a bench and I, of course, devoured mine pretty quickly.  Lola began to throw little bits of her cookie for the birds, which swarmed immediately.  I suggested that birds should probably not eat chocolate, but she didn't seem to agree with me.  Soon a couple of curious squirrels came over, as well as the mysterious pigeon boy who does not say much but held bread in his hand while the birds landed on him.  I couldn't really tell if he was a real person or just some sort of interesting spirit.  Anyway...Lola hand-fed a piece of cookie to one of our squirrel friends.  Well, he took a liking to it so much that he snuck up a minute later and snatched the remaining half cookie out of Lola's hand and took off!  We watched him nibble on it delicately in a flower bed, turning it around and around in his T-Rex style hands.  Then he got a good grip on it with his mouth and scurried up the neighboring tree.  Lola claimed she didn't like the cookie much anyway.  I know she was just thrilled to have such close contact with the animal she has been talking about wanting for a pet for days.  ...mythical birds...  Last night we did the most unusual for us...we went to a pub (Peter McManus - or McManus' as it is known to insiders- to be exact) to watch the Jayhawks humiliate Marquette.  Adam K. and I got a head start on drinking while waiting for Jer to show up from work.  It was a good time.  We enjoyed the game, but mainly got caught up in talking, eating simple pub food, and drinking beers and cider.  The only drawback was that McManus' reffered to french fries as...da da duh...freedom fries.  Sigh. The Jayhawks were...great!  Will they win on Monday?  Will Roy Williams stay on as coach?  Why does Kirk Hinrich look like a Beastie Boy?  We shall soon find out...well, probably not about Kirk.  Anyway...I'm not even a KU alum (but 3 of my grandparents and both of my parents are) but I must say I have a spot in my heart reserved for KU basketball.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...little...  The day after tomorrow I am heading back West.  I get to visit with family and friends, attend a cool textile conference, celebrate my sister's birthday, and close on our HOUSE!  I'm sure people are sick of hearing about it...then again, I'm not sure how many people actually read this.  Ah well.  I can't wait to get my hands on paint samples and start going nuts on the house...joy.  Last Saturday I volunteered, for some odd reason, to go up to Beacon, New York, and work at the Dia's new art space up there.  It is huge and very busy.  It wasn't very hard work, but I had to get up early in order to make it there in time (it's an 80 min. train ride from Grand Central) and by the end of the day I really wanted to just quit seeing people.  The train ride was...fantastic.  Hanging around all day was the kind of mist that refuses to burn off.  The telephone wires dipped like curvy sheet music alongside the water.  I saw places that would have been my secret spots when I was a kid.  It made me wonder why people live in the city when this is so close by...New York does have it's good points and it's own brand of beauty, but...man, that train ride was great.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...my precious saturday...  The coffee pot exhaled like a sighing dragon, moist and whistful.  My knife paused at the outer flesh of the strawberry, then with a little bit of effort, cut it's way through stopping at my thumb.  A cat's hungry meow wanting approval to begin eating.  Sweat shirt sleeves pushed up to my elbows revealing wrists that have gotten a little more slender lately; the natural shedding of winter pounds.      Cold water poured into a freshly cleaned mason jar.  Brown sugar and half-and-half mingling in the base of a big, ceramic mug before the introduction of strong coffee.  Hair pulled into a sensible ponytail, my part is a little crooked.  He always says these shoes are more like expensive slippers, but I could not resist their shade of blue and excellent craftsmanship.  My jeans gather at my ankles, and my t-shirt is almost too thin to decently wear in public.  First take that water out and place it up, away from curious, delicate cat paws.  Then the cereal bowl and coffee.  I place everything on the table, turn on a movie, sink into the couch, slip off my shoes and enjoy my Saturday.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...keep those fingers crossed...

It has wood floors, a cool fire place with fancy brick patterns around it, a built in niche above for displaying whatever one feels like, plaster walls, 4 bedrooms (one of which will be my studio!), lots of light, a quiet street within walking distance of many cool things - Brookside shopping area, SRO video (coolest local video store ever), our favorite Indian restaraunt Taj Mahal, our good friend Johnny, a little artist co-op store, a good coffee shop, etc., enough space and light for a veggie garden, and so much more!  I have not even seen it yet!  I have seen pictures on the web, but Jeremy has seen it in real life, and I completely trust his judgement.  This is sooo much fun!  I still cannot believe that everything is happening, and so quickly.  I keep waiting for someone to snatch it all away from us, but I do not think that is actually going to happen *knock on wood.*  I have been knocking on a lot of wood lately - not THAT wood sicko...wait...maybe I am the only sicko around here.  So...Jeremy comes home tonight, which is FANTASTIC.  Things just aren't as exciting without him.    \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...gone to the wind...  Ba bere na bere na...my husband is gone...ba bere na bere na...there's a silence hangin' over me...ba bere na bere na...the cat is scratichin' at papers and drivin' me cra-zy oh!  I've got the blues...the husband-out-of-town-life-ain't-as-exciting-there-is-no-one-to-sing-funny-songs-to-except-the-cats blues! Actually...I do miss the fellow tons, but being alone is not so terrible.  Things are good.  AND he is trying to get us a house which is very good, very good!  We were even pre-approved for a mortgage...by a real bank!  Can ya believe it?  I'm so excited...I want to decorate something sooo bad.  Maybe to satisfy my urges, I will decorate pieces of paper tonight with letters of the alphabet and send them to friends.  Well...after Buffy!    \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...obrigada...  Boppin' along 5th avenue with fresh food co-op purchases in my roll-y cart (mmm...kale, baby wild ramps, patty pan squash, avocado...and all organic) when what should overcome me...Portugal!  I smelled grilling meat and sardines with a little salt rubbed on them.  There was a slight breeze, perfect temperature...sigh...where are those lazy days?  Though,these days are not bad...just different.    I also discovered that the woman on the corner a block away from our place who sells the fried meat pockets has ones with just cheese!  Yay!  I can partake in fried goodness too!  And how good it was with a little Tapatio hot sauce sprinkled on.  Maybe I should go down to the subway and see if the whole-mango-sliced-up-in-a-zip-lock-bag-with-a-fork people are there.  I love street food!!!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...candy wrappers from heaven...  In the wake of some bumblebee dirigibles was the scent of four years of my life.  Suddenly every pore was filled with those memories of dusty yarn, late nights, solvents, baggy pants with pockets, stink of 500 students, laying on the lawn, every face being known, small classes, the clang-shush of a loom, the slightly sour earth smell of clay, crazy apartment, passion, tears, fights, and a great time.  Who knew I would have found it again on 22nd Street between 9th and 8th in New York City?\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...a new york minute...  So, for about the last week I have been really into trying to cram in New York-y stuff I have been meaning to do all along, but never bothered to do until now.  It's been great!  Now it will be even harder to leave...  My first Lola-free day after Dia I headed down to the Lower East Side  to pick up a couple food items.  We were in the middle of a crazy heat wave, which made walking a chore.  I first went to   urlLink Kossar's Bialys  and picked up a baker's dozen.  Then I took a few steps down the street and bought a quart of half-sours (with a couple new pickles thrown in) at the  urlLink Pickle Guys.   The most well-known pickle place in NYC is probably Gus's Pickles, but they moved to Orchard Street, and the guy who runs Pickle Guys used to work for Gus's.  They have a big war going on, but I read on  urlLink chow hound  that the Pickle Guys have slightly lower prices and are just as good, if not possibly a little better.  I don't know.  I do know that I picked up some amazing pickles.  It's such a fun place just to see...barrels of pickles, plus olives, pickled tomatoes, garlic, celery, peppers, etc.  It smells wonderful in there too!  As for other New York stuff I have been up to, yesterday I went to  urlLink Coney Island  to help celebrate Lola turning 5!  What a fun place for so many reasons!  Unfortunately, Jer could not come.  We first met in the Museum and had some pizza, cake, and pinata smashing.  Actually, it was really terrifying because at one point the kids just were tearing at the poor unicorn with their hands.  Kate also got smashed in the chest  with the pole!  Yow.  Then we headed to the kiddie park and got to ride for a couple hours free.  It was gorgeously sunny, the beach is right there, the kids and adults were having tons of fun...I only rode a couple of things.  I went on the free fall with Lola and some of her friends, and then later I took on the  urlLink Wonder Wheel  with Seth, two other parents and three kids.  We only rode on the stationary cars on the outside of the wheel instead of the ones that swing like crazy on the inside.  It was still totally awesome!  Ferris wheels are my favorite!  After that, things were kind of winding down, so I swung by  urlLink Nathan's  for some cheese fries and a coke, then got on the W and headed for home.  I'm really going to miss New York, and especially Brooklyn.  Kansas City will always be home, but Brooklyn has found it's way permanently into my heart too, and I am sad to leave.  I definitely want our future children to know New York well, and feel comfortable there.  Anyway...Jeremy and I are going back to Coney Island next weekend since he has never been there, and there was a lot I did not do!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...now i'm a believer...  So, I am really no longer going to doubt Johnny.  For months he has been saying he was just going to show up one day in Brooklyn.  All last week he kept telling us, \"See you on Friday!\"  Didn't believe him.  So...Friday after work I headed on over to Peter and Joanne's for dinner with them, Bea, Dollar Bill (Jeremy's cousin) and Jer.  I'm enjoying the conversation, eating cheese and crackers when who should come sauntering in with Jeremy...Johnny!  That old trickster!  We had a good night - Thai food, fantastic hospitality, talking, etc.   After leaving Peter and Joanne's, the three of us headed back to Brooklyn to go to the bar Freddie's where Brian and Laura's band, Dust Dive, was playing for Brian's birthday.  Their music is...sigh...beautiful.  It breaks my heart.  Then it was home, home, home...late.  Saturday Johnny and I decided to adventure since Jeremy was at work.  We had lunch at Daisy's diner then decided that  urlLink this  was where we needed to head.  This museum is actually a room, and not much more.  After entering a non-descript building on Union Square East and finding \"suite\" 600, we walked into a room of people whose heads all turned as they proclaimed, \"Wow!  Real visitors!\"  We were given the grand tour and had it explained to us that they rent out their space for various groups to meet in.  We had interrupted the Star Wars fan club of New York meeting!  There were no hipsters in sight, and we even had one guy say, \"I am the comic book guy.\" They all cleared out soon after and we could actually get to the walls, which featured work from the book \"Broad Appeal\" - all cartoons by women artists.  As we were talking to our tour guide once again, another worker (ponytail, pale skin, black clothes) came out with a stack of papers and said,\"What, praytell, shall I do with these?\"  Wow.  It was a good time, and I highly recommend supporting them if you ever find your way to New York. I'm going to sum up the rest of the day/night quickly - we left, called Bill, walked many blocks in the rain laughing, got to the Dia, caught a cab to Guru for dinner with Jer, walked around the East Village, had a sticker booth picture made of us with a Zapatista frame, met up with Judie and Bill at Gem Spa,  Judie left and Bill came with us to Brooklyn, partied late into the night with beverages and such, Bill threw down some rhymes, lots of stories and laughing, we tossed Bill into a cab about 1:30, I crashed, the others crashed, Bea called us at 6:00 a.m. freaking out wondering where Bill was (he had slept in the lobby apparently.)  Then it was time for work...  Sunday passed as it usually does...no need to go into it. Monday we bid farewell to Johnny (we miss you buddy!) and hello to furniture and art that Rick passed on to us.  This was the last time I get to see Rick before he moves to South Carolina.  I don't know when I will see him next...this is sad.  I have become close to Jeremy's family here, and it is hard to move away, and have them move away.  I guess these things must be done.  Good luck with your train trip, Rick, as well as settlin' in to a new place.  I'm exhausted by all of these words.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...ha ha...  I just fixed the Wilders link.

I am going to use the cool link-y thing that  urlLink Julie  showed me so long ago.  Besides getting to do fun things like hand over large cashier's checks in exchange for land that long ago was just that...land, and hang out with good people, last week I attended the  urlLink Surface Design Association conference.   I attended lectures, panel discussions, and gallery shows - all pertaining to the fiber arts.  I also went to the opening dinner where who else should be playing but  urlLink The Wilders  who played at our wedding!  It wasn't too surprising considering that Phil of The Wilders works for the Art Institute where this grand conference was being held.  Anyway, it was great to see them, but most of all to hear them!  They are good people.   So, I had a very packed week...I missed my husband though.  I wish we could have been in the same place!  Well...sometimes it just can't work out.    Here are a couple of other links I just feel like throwing in for the heck of it:  urlLink Nest magazine -so cool.   I will be getting a subscription now that I have a permanent address.  Our friend  urlLink Adam  and if you are really cool you can visit his  urlLink blog.   Here's one more little tidbit...did you know that Springfield, Missouri is the birthplace of the way most people enjoy  urlLink cashew chicken?   I was doubtful at first...the information came from our friend Johnny who has been known to stretch the truth...then again, he knows many things...Anyway, we did a google search and lordy it is true!  Save us all.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...pulling the strings together...  Lately I have been feeling a little like the miniature hot air balloons my Dad used to make in college out of paper bags and candles...the ability to go far - soar high, but delicate...I might catch fire at any moment.  It has been constant going, going, going...but when is it never?  I've been a bit of a complainicus I must say - Jeremy hears most of it, a little on edge, a little more manic songstressing, yet...I am happy for so many reasons.    Here are my reasons to celebrate today: the sudden tan-ness of my arms, Frank leaning his pink nose into the waves of the song coming from my mouth, a sweaty jar of Coke leaving rings on the beat-up desk, picking out paint colors for the house...brazilian blue, artichoke heart, laguna yellow, burnt cumin..., little kisses that cover your face, the hot sauce burn of Tapatio on my lips, wearing flip flops, seeing the cycle of life displayed in the gutter even though it was extremely sad, music that you can't sit still through, and...last but not least...it's Rick's birthday!  A real reason to celebrate!  Happy Birthday Rick! I just realized today that next Monday will be the first time I will have seen him in awhile, and the last time I will for x amount of time considering he leaves for South Carolina in a little over a week.  Everyone is on the go...I hope none of you catch on fire before you land.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...last call...  Our internet is being taken away from us today.  Think of it...no connection by that means for probably two weeks...shudder.  I can't believe how tied in with it I am.  I didn't even get email until I was in college!  It will be okay...I can focus on other things...like how we are getting cell phones!  (They still have not arrived...it was a whole drama yesterday that ended with Jeremy telling them not to call us until they are ready to say that 2 cell phones will be here by Tuesday...they called, so we will see) That, I am still not too sure about how I feel.  Jeremy's is for his work, which makes sense, but mine is not so much for that purpose.  Definitely don't want to make it my primary phone, no no no!  I'm sure I'll enjoy it, but I'm the person who still talks into them funny, like I don't trust that the people can hear me if the mouthpiece is halfway up my cheek.  I've seriously only talked on one three times.  Anyway...technology...bah!    New York...who knew a Kansas City girl could fall in love.  Don't get me wrong...I am VERY excited to be moving back, but I love my neighborhood here, and riding subways, and walking around trying to figure out who it would be okay to make eye contact with, and being able to have any type of food I want at most likely any hour, and most of all different family and friends.  I know we are coming back for visits every year-ish, but...sigh.  Alright, it's list time...all New York lists...  Famous People I Saw (or almost saw) While Living Here: Jacques Torres John Waters Lou Reed Laurie Anderson Duff Pauly Shore (Heather and I were walking and she saw him sitting, but I was spacing off and totally missed everything) Rachel Dratsch Robert Whitman Chuck Close Jo Baer uhhh...alright, I'm tired of this list  All Time Favorite Experiences In New York:  Zoe greeting me every time I come in or out of our building, sitting on the beach at Fire Island with the sky all gray and a fine salt mist devouring me, walking to the co-op especially on Saturdays,  going out to Mexican food with Juhanni, Rebecca, Chris, and Carlin, this one lunch - a long time ago- with Adam and Angela...it was a Saturday, Indian food, and then a great stroll down 1st ave..., hanging out with Lola in Union Square almost every day, going to the Comic and Cartoon museum with Johnny, having Heather over for making-dinner-watching-Sunday-cartoons nights while she still lived here, chatting with Corrie up in the Dia cafe, getting to see Dust Dive twice, long talks with Nancy and Richard upstairs, meeting and getting to know Adam K, when Lola's family would give me a ride home...never boring!, shutting the door in Luis's face,  that special corner on our block where you can spy on the Statue of Liberty, Ukranian Borchst...any Monday I want, dinner at Bea's - telling stories, Joan's birthday party, our wedding reception at Guru!, spending time with Rick, dinner at Peter and Joanne's, fourth of July this year, hanging out with Arno and Susie, all the things I noticed walking around town, the subway stop for The Natural History Museum,  having Josh, Julie and Morgan visit, riding on the ottomans with Christine at work, dancing in the office at work, bringing home lots of good food from the co-op, sitting on the stoop and having people stopping to talk, flying over New York knowing we are about to touch down, those little tile faces I've been seeing around, running into Jeremy by surprise on the subway, riding the Wonder Wheel with an absolutely terrified Jer (hey...he suggested it!), our anniversary...brunch at Sidewalk-walking around the East Village, ...too much more to list.  Lot's is going to happen in those two weeks...Rachel turns 14, driving with two kitty boys to K.C., our fridge gets delivered (it's stainless steel with a freezer on the bottom...pretty), I visit my Dad in the nursing home for the first time...Here's to everything that has already occurred and to the unknown, may it be as fun, mysterious, heart tearing, frustrating, lovely, wild, boring, tiring, and inspiring as all that already is. Safe travels to everyone...and love!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...keep me...  The day has only just started and I don't want to pack!  La, la, la!  Let's just eat bowls of sweetened corn puffs and forget all that we have to do.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...it's getting hot in here...  Last night we met up with  urlLink Adam  to go have a little dinner, then head to the Cutting Room where his friend  urlLink Adam Dugas  was singing a few songs, including his version of Nelly's It's Getting Hot in Here!  Also performing were  urlLink The World Famous Pontani Sisters.   Glittery costumes, huge smiles, fake eyelashes, old fashioned dance moves...bringing back the burlesque atmosphere!  It was the best show I have seen in a long time.  Plus, there was Dana Pontani (singing), the Fisherman Xylophonic Burlesque Orchestra (awesome!  the xylophone guy wears a fez!), Jo Boobs ( does not show it all, but can twirl her tassels well), and Oh De Twirlette.  Yay!   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...stunted...  Wouldn't you know that the urge to just sit down and super focus on art would come at the most inopportune time?  There are boxes to pack, jobs to finish, people to say goodbye to, streets to walk on one more time before moving, things to eat that you just can't find elsewhere, etc.  No rest for the wicked.  I also have a sudden need to look at things that are already packed, such as certain books.  It is hard to believe that the time is so near.  Sigh.  I love our house we are moving to, and I love Kansas City, but...I love New York now too.  Even though I like to complain about the city often (hey...from what I can tell most New Yorkers do) it's really grown on me.  Thankfully, we have many reasons to visit: Adam, Angela, Bea, Judie, Brian, Joanne, Peter, Adam K., Nancy, Christine, Corrie...  Jeremy just called me blog horn leg horn!  He makes everything better!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...burn a dollar...  Jeremy and I are not huge supporters of July 4th, but we do enjoy fireworks.  Fortunately, his cousin (actually first cousin once removed) Susan was in town from Nepal, so we were able to enjoy them from the balcony of May's old apartment.  It was good to see Susie.  She always is fun to talk with.  Her friend Viva, who is her neighbor in Nepal, was also in town.  By the time the fireworks came, Francis from across the hall was over, and their friend Azalia was there as well.    I could not believe the display that New York has!  We could actually see two different ones from our vantage point, but one was far superior as we could see all three parts of it.  The view from May's bedroom was even more spectacular.  I had a hard time deciding which view I preferred.  On the balconey, you felt more a part of the whole city and could hear the collective ahhing and clapping of millions of people.  We had been watching, as dusk grew, people gathering on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings.  After dark, we could only see them in the flashes from the fireworks and hear that they were there, and very much alive.  At one point a small boy yelled out, \"I wish this was every night!\"  I think many people replied to him, \"Me too!\"  The fireworks were like neurons, and petri dish growth, and flowers, and things from every part of nature come to life in an extra huge version of gold, violet, red, blue, white, green, orange explosion!  I was fighting back tears at how something so simple can be so beautiful.  It brought lots of memories, especially from when I was a kid, to the surface.  If you were to have asked me at that moment, I probably would have told you my childhood was terrific, because I could only remember those sticky, summer nights where bug repellent, barbeque smoke, and fresh cut grass are wrestling to have the largest smell.  Fireflies are creating there own light display every night, and don't seem to mind being caught every once in a while.  You can stay up later, because the sun doesn't ever want to set, and there is no worry of having to go to school the next day.  There are more excuses than ever to eat candy, drink soda, and nosh on things all day long.  That's exactly what we did at Suzie's!  Mmm...cookies, grapes, Coke, hummus, potato chips...I wish we could have stayed in that moment longer, but...it's good to know that there are so many moments in time where I feel that...I don't want to leave or ever have it end.  Luckily, I try not to have much space at all in between those times.  Those are the times when I don't worry about anything, and I don't get so frustrated that I proclaim, \"Ugh!  I can't stand people!\"  There probably needs to be less of that in everyone's life.  ...family matters...  We finally downloaded Powerpoint so that we could look at the cd of family photographs and stories that we got from Rick, via Arno (Jeremy's second cousin I believe)  It is an extremely long slideshow, but you just don't want to stop!  I'm interested in any person's photograph collection, but this was extra good because it's Jeremy's family.  I think there is somewhere around six to seven hundred photographs spanning from 1900 to 2002/3!  Arno had, and still has, a huge task ahead of him, and the end result is great!!!  I think this is how I may want to organize all of the stuff for my family...we'll see.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...open up and say ahhh...  The rains have been sent to us!  I'm sitting up here in our cozy little tv room, typing away, drinking strong coffee, and watching the puddles in our neighbor's patio chairs grow larger by the second.  When the rain first started a day or two ago you could almost hear the grass and other plants collectively gulp.  My favorite thing though is the fact that in our kitchen the rain sounds like popcorn exploding as it hits the stove exhaust pipe on the roof!    \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...hide your sons and daughters...  Yowzer, we are back on line!  It wasn't too bad being away.  I could do it again easily.  We just got back at 2:30 this morning from Detroit where we had to bid adieu to Joan and Rachel.  Even though it was an extremely short visit, we had a fantastic time.  Jer and I got to have Rachel to ourselves for a good portion of a day...she is just the coolest.  I am so happy that Rachel is in my life.  Joan made a really yummy meal of veg sheppard's pie and green beans with shitakes. Mmmm.  Jer and I had a good breakfast with just Joan that was fun.  I love my in-laws!  Our stuff arrived less than a week ago.  I immediately set up the kitchen, as it is a very important room for me, and am now focusing on my studio.  Life is good.  It's very weird to drive almost everywhere.  Not that I have been wanting to walk in the 105 degree heat, but I'm missing out on all the little stuff you get to notice while strolling around town.  There are other things though...we had about 15 peace lillies (our friend Matt told us they were actually surprise lillies) surface in our back yard.  My Daddad has some too that were transferred years ago from my great-grandfather's garden.  I think I am going to take some of those bulbs this fall.  We have a chorus of crickets in our basement that sing us to sleep - Bones caught one and ate it with a sickening crunch!  We have lots of spiders patrolling the premises making sure that no corner goes un-woven.  There is an organic farmer's market about a mile away from us on Saturday mornings!  Everything is coming together.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...how prophetic...  Well...what a couple of weeks it has been.  I was not really prepared for any of it...during the evening of Monday, July 21st, my father passed away unexpectedly in a sense.  That night...I can't even really talk about that night.  The next morning everything got picked up...taken away so quickly...then we ate our final slice of Aniello's pizza, shoved everything in the car including the cats as loud, electric pops of thunder started breaking loose.  I hopped behind the wheel and we had one of the scariest drives to Pennsylvania (due to horrible storms) that I have ever experienced.  Everything happened so fast...when we arrived in town on Thursday, I immediately went to a meeting at the place where the memorial was going occur.  As of today, our belongings have still not arrived and are not scheduled to for another week and a half!  Never use Mayflower!  My father...this is all I want to say about him...he was a lot of things, but the things I have been remembering the most is his love for us, and really for life around him.  I've been learning even more about him having to go through his belongings.  I've found the rolls of photos taken solely of the television during the moon landing, slides he took himself of celestial things through the telescope that he built, letters he wrote defending his work and actions when employers accussed him of things like not doing stuff in a timely manner, etc., stuff about the Registar system that he developed, his slide rule, his bowling ball, his old camera, his shoe shine kit, so many papers with equation after equation...notes... I really wish I could have been here... I can't really talk about it anymore, so I'm not going to.   So...yeah...our stuff is not here, but the house is!  It's a good house.  Kansas City is certainly here and real.  Everything slipped into place so perfectly - driving, visiting friends and family, knowing where to get anything.  Whenever I have thought about New York it has seemed not real.  We lived a similar life there in many senses, but in others it was so different!  No one here really knows that life we had, and we have been so busy that Jeremy and I have not really discussed it much.  New York worked it's way into my body, and I'm not sure I want to let it go.  I guess I do not have to, as we are planning to return many times.  Kansas City is great...the cicadas are busy talking all day and part of the night, Jeremy bought a truck that is a fraternal twin to the one he had to give up before we moved to Brooklyn, and I can hop over to my Mom's, Daddad's, sister's, etc. whenever I want.  New York...what are you up to?  I'm picturing right now what is likely happening on 14th Street, on 5th avenue, at the Dia, on 23rd Street, in the East Village, at the Buncher's, on Fire Island, at the co-op, in the subway...what a different entity New York is...not better than anywhere else, every place is wonderful in some way...just...I don't know.  Well...I need breakfast  I still don't have regular computer access for another two weeks or so (by the time we hook up internet.) Hoping whoever is out there is well...please tell me you are well. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...i'm falling...  It's almost my birthday month!  Yes, I declare the entire month of October as my own.  This is absolutely my favorite time of year.  I love that I can still wear summery clothes most of the time, but that at night I need to put on a sweater.  Soups, chilis, stews and such are much tastier in the fall.  Halloween is by far the best holiday, and this year we get to super decorate for it, and we should actually have kids that want to trick-or-treat at our place!    Today the first leaves started to fall from the trees, and I noticed at the tip tops of some that the leaves had turned.  Fall makes me a little melancholy (spelling?  one l right?)  I know death and hibernation are coming for nearly everything.  It's a chance to reflect and release things and hope to survive to be reborn in spring.  I really like this aspect of fall.  This is kind of a central theme to my life...my name actually means \"of the resurrection.\"  I love the image of the phoenix, periodically going up in flames only to come back again to repeat the whole process.  I suppose lots of people can relate to that, so I'm not saying it's a unique thing to me by any means.  Hmmm.  Enough reflection...let's go drink some warm apple cider...and eat donuts...mmm...donuts.    \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...chester drawers...  Jeremy and I picked up a handy piece of my old furniture from my Ma's that is perfect for stashing socks, t-shirts, underwear and such.  In order to do that though, I had to clear out the memories: cards for every holiday, elementary writings and yearbooks, stacks of notes illegally passed in class, old photos and objects that were once so important.  Luckily I could part with a paper sacks worth of stuff, so I have less to find a new home for.  Sometimes I wish I was a minimalist.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...saturday, in the park, blah blah blah rest of the lyrics...  Everything today is wet.  There is a mist outside that makes all the plants want to give off their best shade of green before they begin to turn.  Our  neighborhood is dripping with huge trees, flowers, long grass, and vines overtaking whatever stands still for awhile.   No one seems to be awake today.  I know other people are somewhere in town, because I saw them at the farmer's market not too long ago.  70th Terrace is quiet.  Anyone with sense is still in bed, excited that quilts have needed to return.   This is when I listen...no need to talk except for the occassional exchange with a kitty.  The cicadas died out with the hot weather, so now all of the other insects can be heard singing their pleas for mates.  They mix in with the questioning purrs of Bones, the wood floors creaking under delicate cat paws and me shifting in my chair, the constant hum of the computer and click clicky of keys, fingers rubbing on a ceramic bowl, green tea juicily slurping into my mouth, and the distant sounds of what few cars seem to be out there this morning, but I have yet to see from my window.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...whatever happens...  I wish there was some sort of vaccum that could suck all of the snot from my head, yet not touch my brain.  I would appreciate that right about...now.    My Mom was adopted by an almost all black cat.  Just in time for Halloween!  She named him Spooky.  The fact that she took him in is very funny considering all of my life she has not enjoyed cats.  Spooky worked his magic on her though, and they are great companions.  He is very sweet and declawed, and she has something to talk baby talk to and to calm her down a bit.  We are working on moving Rick to Kansas City soon.  I'm pretty excited.  I like having family near by (well...yeah, yeah I do) and he can meet my family, and check out all the things we love about Kansas City, and I'm sure find things that we don't even know about!    The other day we were making our way through the Westport Art Fair when we realized, \"Oh!  We're right by Murray's Ice Cream Shop!  How odd...I almost forgot it was there!\"  Murray's is only the best ice cream in town.  No flavors felt right until my eyes fell upon the name *Pink Grapefruit Champagne Sorbet*  Mmmm...delicious.  I think it was the most satisfying frozen experience I have had all summer.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...skeletons in my closet (actually they're on my front door)...  The day of all days is here!  My eyes keep getting drawn back to the large bowl of candy I fixed up this morning - junior mints, shock tarts, reece's peanut butter cups, milk duds, gumballs...drool...Must take my mind off of sweet, sweet candy...must not become diabetic...  So instead I am focusing on sounds today.  The tornado siren-like squeal of the dryer, the rustle of embroidery thread repeatedly being pulled through linen, pops of old wood floors, the wet hiss of the coffee pot, and the giant BOOM of a transformer blowing this morning that tore me from my dream world.  The power was only gone an hour or so.  Tonight we do the dance of passing out candy to  kids.  Jeremy and I discussed the various approaches to doing this, and I believe my way won out - mainly because I say so.  He thinks the kids should be allowed to take their own candy from the bowl.  While I remember this being a wonderful thing when I was a kid, now I can only see little, sticky fingers shoveling as much candy as they can into their bag.  I'm for passing out one or two pieces per kid, and I get to randomly decide what those pieces shall be.  You can trade up later kid...I'm not taking requests.  Jeremy thinks this is another attempt of mine to take kids down a notch.  Hey...I just want to make sure everyone gets a piece of the pie...er...I mean candy.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...stranded at the drive-in...  We tossed an armload of blankets and pillows in the car, and took off Saturday night to meet Christine, Evan, Liz, and Hillary for a double-feature at the drive-in.  Texas Chainsaw Massacre is very frightening when viewed in your own car, surrounded by night, and having to go to the bathroom, but not wanting to go anywhere by yourself after that flick.  We survived though.  I pulled the blanket up over my eyes a couple of times...of course it is a loosely crocheted blanket, so I could still see anyway.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 was the next movie.  Very good again, but quite violent.  I love the way Tarantino matches up music to what is happening in the film.  Sunday... I don't know what I did to deserve this, but Jer made french toast and fake bacon for our very late breakfast.  Yummmm.  Then we just lazed around with the various visitors that called on us, until Jer had to go to work.  Fantastic.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...till next year...  The party is over.  At least, the birthday party, not the party that is everyday of my life! (ha.)  A quarter of a century does not feel that different than last year, at least so far.  We'll see what is in store for this one...  The sun is still shining, and the leaves are still breaking delicately beneath my feet.  Halloween is not far away, and thankfully we have not eaten all of the candy...well...I had to buy another bag or two that we haven't opened, but we never finished off the original one!  My head is overflowing with things I want to work on in studio, strangers are calling Jer to have their pianos tuned, and the cats are still rearranging the rugs every night.    \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...what's goin' on...  A cold rain is falling outside, and the sun is almost gone for the day.  Jeremy is already at work  for the night.  I am currently reading \"My Invented Country\" by Isabel Allende and \"Stupid White Men\" by Michael Moore.  This morning I started my \"Sweatin' to the Oldies\" workout.  Richard Simmons is pretty fun.  I've been working on art and cleaning the house.  my birthday is tuesday shhhh...Tonight I am going to watch Friends and ER.  Tomorrow I am going to make Morrocan carrot spread, onion dip, and hummus for an upcoming shin-dig.  I have begun to master medium-level spider solitaire.  I need to write some letters.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...who knew...  I dropped my car off this morning for an oil change, etc., and, thankfully, had to walk home.  It's only about a ten-minute walk, but in that time I learned lots about Gregory (the street) that I had never known just driving on it. A few trees have some bluish-white mossy spots on them.  They come right after the tree that has seaweed-like pods hanging from it.  I am not sure if these have the same delicious sounding/feeling pop-hiss to them as the seaweed does, but they looked like it.  There was also a stretch of trees that not only has regular, dark green leaves on it, but light green ones curled down like little tongues waiting to lick those who walk under it's branches.  The tongues cradled some sort of berry, most likely not edible. I think in our neighborhood that the plants are ready to take over.  If only people would leave them alone!  The sidewalks are already severely buckled in some parts, with plants sneaking their way out of every crevice.  Lots of people have ivy creeping up their houses or fully engulfing their chimneys.  If we all disappeared, it would not take very long for the ferns, trees, flowers, ivy, all of them, to claim everything as their own.  They silently pass the time...waiting for the long moments of their uprising...lucky plants...\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...heavy whipping cream...  Now you can witness how truly flip-floppy I am...going from serious thought to...  I just wandered downstairs for a brief interlude and found Bones, our resident heat monkey, sitting in front of the air vent in the dining room, lapping up the waves of warm air.  I'm seriously considering heating up a sticky bun my mother bought for me even though it is practically midnight.  Conan is coming on t.v.  (that sounds a bit crude...sorry) and I find him highly amusing...in fact so much that I am going to say, goodnight.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...how does this happen...  Do you ever zoom out from your life and realize how ridiculous so many things are with it, and with the world in general?  Here I am...I own a house with my best friend and partner, I currently have no income because my husband is making money and I am a semi-privelaged person, I have lots of things...in fact I have so many that I get rid of tons of clothing, paper, whatever each year, I never miss a meal unless I choose to, I have never had an act of physical violence done against me, I went to college - to art shcool none the less, I have traveled all over the place... I am so lucky.  How did I get this place in the scheme of things, yet other people have none of what I do?  Did I do something really good in a past life, or am I destined to do not as well in the next one?  Does God or whatever there is just like some people better for no good reason?  And why am I not doing more with what I have to help those who have not?...is it even \"better\" to be the one who has?...what is the perfect existence,  when you have what you need - food, shelter, love, good health, a whole range of emotions - and not too many things to bog you down - jobs, obligations, guilt, wants, and you know of no one else who needs anything?  Does that exist?   I have had times throughout my life so far where I fight harder than usual for basic rights for all, for justice, for universal happiness, for something - anything...then...life sucks me back in and it is easy to forget other people.  I walk down the street with a veil.  We think it is so horrible that Muslim women are forced to fully cover in public, but we are a society that is still covered ourselves, and we like it!  You just can't see ours and it is self-imposed. It's so easy to sit here - in my jeans, t-shirt, and cowboy boots - and type on my computer, and drink my fresh water, and expound upon what is wrong with the world.  What are my solutions?  This is the toughy...I don't know.  I guess I will try to be a good person and not use too much of anything, though that's easier said than done for the lifestyle we have become accustomed to.  I will raise any children I have to please, please, please question things, and want to drink up any books, magazines, newspapers, people, dances, songs, art, animals, vistas, whatever that they come across, and to help, and love, and do something as long as they fully embrace it and believe in it.  I will do what I can before I burn (not in Hell, I don't believe in it...in actual flames...I want to be cremated) and try not to feel too guilty for what I cannot do.  That is very hard.  For now...universe...ever expanding (or is it actually shrinking?)...I love you, whatever happens, whether you take it all away or give me more (I really don't need more)...thank you for it all...please give other people breaks...please do something to equalize us all - or is that for us to figure out?   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...birthday suit...  Happy Birthday to my wonderful husband Jeremy!  Like a fine wine, he gets better every year (and he was definitely not bad at all to begin with!)  Jeremy brings much happiness into my life, and others as well.  I don't know what I would do without you sweet potato!  I love you!   Last Saturday we paused for lunch at the New York Deli and Bakery, then continued on our walk to Forest Hill Cemetary.  This is all only a few blocks from our house, and happens to be the final resting spot of my Mama (Mom's mom), her parents Tola and Herbert, Herbert's parents, his sister and her husband, and Tola's brother and his wife, as well as a future plot for my Daddad...which is a little creepy to look at as he is still very much alive.  Anyway, on Sunday was the 15 year anniversary of Mama's passing, so we went to say hello.  We ended up walking around the cemetary (which is huge) for over an hour...checking out crazy mausoleums, and interesting tombstones.  As we headed for the gates, we noticed that the crows had formed a barrier that we must cross.  I got a little nervous, and prepared to offer them something shiny, but they were distracted and took off for some nearby trees.  Silly crows.  Saturday night we got to hang out at Scot and Marla's place.  It was Scot's birthday, but he failed to tell us that!  So...Scot...I'm outing you publically...happy birthday again...late...  Anyway, we had a good time, and were the first to arrive and the last to leave.  Why, do you ask?  Because we are those people.    Sunday was Mary's flute performance.  She is getting her PhD in flute, so this was no ordinary, 4th grade concert.  It let me see a whole new side of Mary.  We enjoyed it a lot.  Today the temperature is in the 70s.  Why am I in here typing?  Oh yeah...Jer is in the shower, then we are going out.  I'm looking forward to these upcoming days as there are many things I get to cook for our two Thanksgiving feast we get to attend...fruit salad, nutloaf, chocolate raspberry birthday cake, Fafa's (my great grandpa Herbert) caramels, Birdie's (my Dad's Mom's mom) swedish pecans, cheddar cheese buttermilk biscuits...drool...plus, soon I will start printing various cards - some to sell and some to send out for the holidays!  Yay!  I love having things to do.  The more I have to do, the better I use my time.  Happy Birthday again, Jer.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...just like josh...    You are the Low-Fidelity All-Star.  You were born with your cool, and it's totally natural.

On Friday, since Jeremy didn't have to work, we had a nice little date of slices of Joe's pizza, and seeing Lost In Translation at the Tivoli.  It was a very sweet movie, and shot nicely.  When we returned home, I treated myself to a nice, warm bath with my new bath salts and the rest of a bottle of white wine to sip.  Ahhhh.  I feel much better than earlier in the week.  Saturday we not only got the pleasure of hanging out with Kris and Joanna, but we got to babysit 1 1/2 year old Nora for a couple of hours.  I just want to make her laugh all the time!  She was so much fun to play with, and she talks a lot.  Besides all of this, I have been fairly non-stop working on my easy-cut print blocks for my alphabet cards.  I got the material on Thursday, and I haven't been able to keep my hands off of it.  Well, it's just past one a.m. and my hands are chilly...I spy Frank on the futon, so I think I am going to go steal some of his body heat.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...one toe over the edge...  I screamed at a man on the phone this morning...he's with the Mayflower moving company.  We got a letter in the mail today that just made a rage brew in me.  I wish my screaming could have penetrated the heart of the corporate beast like a sword...be felt throughout the whole body...make it quake and question.  Instead I was yelling at an outer scale.  I don't feel fully sorry for doing it, though I always feel pretty bad for yelling at anyone.  It brought up lots of issues.  I'm partly feeling the sting of realizing my own naivete and stupidity regarding the move, and it sucks having to admit it's not all on somebody else.  It also just transported me back to those days of summer, when everything was so right for awhile, and then just got dashed into the ground.  I guess I've been suppressing a lot of sadness towards what happened with my dad.  I just released it all on Jeremy...poor guy.  Then I felt the sudden need to blindly write something down here.  I don't really need to talk to anyone specifically, I guess I just need to have something concrete come out of me...something I can look at.  Things aren't that bad.  I love my husband, myself, our life, our cats, friends, family, our house.  Sometimes I need to realize it's okay to embrace sadness, and that it doesn't have to be put in a spot where no one can see it.  So...now I'm realizing other people besides me look at this.  Uh...hi...please don't think I'm crazy or depressed.  I'm normal...yeah...normal... :)   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...just thinking...  My mind today keeps wandering to the painting that presides over my Daddad's living room.  I'm scanning over the seaweed covered rocks that shine in the moonlight.  The ships look so weathered, like the small town behind them in the distance, but not unhappy.  I'm trying to imagine myself on that beach.  You would need a thick, wool sweater I think.  Everything is moist with salt water...can't escape the smell.   A foghorn sounds...there are still some lights on in the town, though it must be past midnight.  I can see the moonlight playing on the surface of the water, trying to illuminate further than the first few inches.  I'll have to be content with not getting in the water, though I want it to cover me.  Too chilly. I think about how in her last years, Mama must have spent a lot of time looking at this painting.  I wonder if she pictured herself wherever it is supposed to be.  She saw beauty in that scene...she was the one who picked it out.  That painting is like a long, deep sigh.    This whole weekend has been trapped in the painting.  It's been days of garlic soup, hearty sweaters, perfectly cured cast-iron pans, fat ceramic mugs of coffee, thick ecru-colored cream, grey, chilly skies, fine mists, sewing by hand, warm cat cuddles, crunchy leaves, seeing your breath, drafty houses...  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...grey days...  At first we thought Halloween was going to be a bust.  It was already 7:00, and we had yet to have any children come knocking.  The door was wide open, I was reading a book on the couch to take my mind off of my excitement.  Is there no such thing anymore as kids going around to houses?  Do they just go to shops for candy now?  What is wrong with the world today - isn't anything sacred?  Finally...two kids came!  Between 7:30 and 8:00 we had a good rush, and we got rid of all of our candy (thankfully...Jeremy and I still ended up with major sugar hangovers the next day)  Witches, a vampire, football player, racecar driver, carebear, princesses, ghosts, and many unidentifiable things graced our porch that night.  Woo-hoo...boo!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...hair today, gone tomorrow...  Kristen, Becky, and I explored two of our fine city's lesser known museums today: The  urlLink hair museum , and the  urlLink puppetry arts institute .  They were both amazing!  I want to learn more about the techniques of hair art...it's so beautiful.   This area has such great museums, and after today I am much more motivated to visit them.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...walkin' in a rainy wonderland...  This time of year is out-of-control!  In a good way.  I think I have been more socially active in the last week than in the past few months combined...well...that's a bit of an exaggeration I suppose.  Lots of friends are in town, and it is also a time for seeing lots of friends who are always in town, just busy people.    This is definitely my favorite time of year mail-wise.  Today was...well...like Christmas!  We received a package from Josh, Julie, and Morgan, as well as about five more holiday cards.  I actually did the thing where you hang the cards you receive around a door frame, or something similar.  I think it is required that you do that if you have a house.  Mainly I just enjoy looking at the interesting cards people make or pick out.  On non-holiday related tips, I have begun reading \"Lonesome Dove,\" and am about a quarter of the way through it.  You should read this book!  Last year our friend Dylan read it while he stayed in our apartment, and he left his copy.  Then, Jeremy's Dad gave us his hard-bound volume before he moved.  It has just been sitting on one of our many bookshelves, silently waiting to be picked up.  I found myself perusing the shelves for something new to read, and fixed my eyes on it.  It has proven to be an excellent choice.  Otherwise...more people are marrying next year, and popping out children...not us...yet.  I am hoping that 2004 will be a year filled with much happiness, and not as much sadness, though I enjoy all of my emotions.  As for weather, since I always seem to have something to say about it, today is grey and rainy.  Maybe it is because when we were watching a rainy scene in \"Igby Goes Down\" last night I was thinking about how nice a good rainy day is sometimes.  That, of course, would be assuming that my thoughts had great powers, and the world revolved around me...which as far as I know it does not, thankfully.  I do not believe that it is supposed to be a snowy Christmas this year, though I guess one never can tell.  I just hope for family, friends, peacefulness, yummy food, and a few presents.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...what has happened to this place...  I just got done reading an article on Salon about the protests that happened in Miami at the end of last week.  Man...I really don't know what to say.  Is there something fundamentally wrong with the human animal?  How can you beat back senior citizens, children, all kinds of people, and actually defend that action, and feel good about it?!   The deal is everyone is different, and should have differing opinions.  It can make things difficult, but that's the beauty of free thought.  No one is better.  When I get pissed is when people don't think for themselves.  We align ourselves fully with the thoughts of our government, our party, our work co-horts, whoever!  It's not bad to agree, but to blindly chant U.S.A., U.S.A., U.S.A., or to hate someone because you are told to, or to watch T.V. all the time because that's what everyone else is doing...this sucks!  Do what you really believe, yet be compassionate along the way. Ugh.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...weather blog...  More snow!  More snow!  A couple of days ago the skies opened up and dropped upon us approximately five inches of snow as well as a bunch of sleet before hand.  Then, last night, it started again.  Pure snow.  I ended up spending the night at my sister's house, and when we woke up...snow!  The drive home was a teensy scary...slippy-slidey.  Once I was back at our house I declared, \"No more outings today!\"  Now it is the perfect Saturday.  My belly is full of tomato soup, grilled cheese, and coffee.  I can sit inside in warmth and peer out the windows at the still gathering flakes, while sipping on a variety of hot beverages.  I love being housebound in the winter!  There is so much here I want to do!   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...bring it on...  Slowly this morning, I climbed the stairs, trying to balance my cup of juice, glass of water, and bowl of cereal.  Placing it all on the table beside the computer, I then plugged in the internet, turned on the computer, and opened up the blinds a tad.  I noticed the frost on the window first, then I saw it...snow!  Our first snow of the year is only one-half to one inch of accumulation, but it is still snow!  We saw a little bit when we were in Michigan for Thanksgiving, but it came after being there for a couple of days.  The trip was very nice.  Jeremy and I rolled up Wednesday night, expecting everyone to already be there, having a jolly old time.  As we discovered, only Alan arrived before us, and he was at the store when we got there!  So, we had a nice chat with him for a couple of hours, and just as he was ready to fall into bed, Josh, Julie, and Morgan arrived.  Meade, Lucas, and Liam followed not too long after.  The visit was:  hiking the dunes on Thanksgiving and being amazed at Morgan's ability, good food and lots of it, competitive scrabble, trivial pursuit, sleeping bag wrestling, talking, talking, talking, Morgan bouncing around and me bouncing around with her, drinking lots of wine, bowling, going to the movies with the boys, very late nights talking, having little Ben- who joined us with his family on Friday-climb into my lap, Jeremy making hot cocoa at one in the morning,  just having a good time.  Now it's been back to reality for a couple of days.  Ah well.  Gotta go work...  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...another weekend another storm...  So tonight we are supposedly in for at least 6 inches of snow, and possibly ice before that.  THEN, as if that weren't enough, it is going to snow another 6 inches on Sunday.  Well...bring it on!  I got some grocery shopping done yesterday, I have new art supplies to play with, and new goals to work towards, my husband is here, our cats are here, we have books, movies, and plenty of entertainment.  Come on storm!  **just don't knock the power out** please!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...mount up...  The other day I was headed out to my car to warm it up so I could chip off the thick layer of ice coating it.  It was maybe 10 in the morning, but very quiet outside.  As I reached the sidewalk, I had this sinking feeling, and felt as if suddenly huge men coated in furs, and riding Shire horses were going to turn on to our street off of Oak, and start riding towards me.   I could almost hear the ram's horn being blown for battle call.  I quickened my pace to get to the car in time.  Once I unlocked the door, I realized I was totally irrational.  It just had that feeling outside...like everyone was gone, and I didn't know it yet, and there are roaming bands of Vikings or something. Maybe I shouldn't read and watch movies so much...\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...blue norther a comin'...  Yesterday there was mass fear of a terrible ice storm, possibly to rival the bad one a couple of years ago that had power out all throughout the metro for a week.  This morning when I woke up, there was ice covering everything, but not any more than some previous freezing rain we have already had this season.  Regardless, I haven't set one toe outside today...chilly, and no place I have to go.  We received organic seeds in the mail yesterday for our upcoming gardening adventure.  Since it will be our first year, we are trying not to be overly ambitious - scarlet nantes carrots, de cicco broccoli, sugar snap snow peas, lettuce/mustard green mix, spinach, brandywine slicing tomatos, yellow pear cherry tomatos, scallions, and  tomatillos.  Plus I think we will be doing a herb selection: dill, oregano, basil, mint, chives, cilantro...maybe more.  There is a lot of work ahead of us, but I think it will be a beneficial endeavor.  I am getting very excited for the weddings that are coming up!  Meleah and Peter were in town a week ago to work on some of their wedding plans, and we, along with Jenny, Pat, Julie, and Carrie had a racous evening of eating and drinking.  I think their wedding is going to be fabulous.  Christine and Evan's wedding planning is in full swing, as is Cynthia and Ross's.  It is really interesting to see how different everyone's approach is to getting married.     \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...farewell...  Yesterday the dental hygenist who was getting ready to work on my teeth said that I had to take out my tongue ring.  I have had it over seven years, and had never taken it out, even for the dentist.  I went along with her, and she insisted that I would still be able to get it back in.   She took the full set of x-rays...didn't get it back...the doctor did his exam...didn't get it back...she spent an hour cleaning and flossing my teeth all the while lecturing me on how I should really floss, and had I heard that tongue rings can cause severe damage to one's teeth...got it back after all of that.  She shooed me into the bathroom to put it back in.  I could only get it partway in...the top hole had already healed.  Sigh.   I had been considering taking it out, but I wanted it to be my decision.  Ah well.  If I had cared more I suppose I would have put up a fuss, and not taken it out in the first place.  So...no more tongue ring.  I keep feeling for it, and am surprised when it is not there.  My tongue misses it...though now it can curl into a taco shape again.  The hygenist also said after she had finished throughly scraping the plaque from my teeth, \"How much coffee do you drink?\"   Oh great I thought...you want to take my coffee away too?! \"Not more than a cup a day, if even that\" I replied.   \"Are there a lot of grounds in your coffee?\" \"No (puzzled)\" \"Well I found some black powdery looking stuff just underneath your gumline.  Do you know what it could be?\" Just then the lightbulb clicked on.  It was the monkey brand tooth powder that my mom...uh, I mean Santa...left in Jeremy's stocking.  It's an Ayurvedic tooth powder from India, and it is indeed very black, and I had used it just before I went there...must not have rinsed well.  I told her about it, and her face kind of twisted into semi-disgust, then she asked in a very condescending manner, \"Does it have flouride in it?\" \"No.\" \"You really shouldn't probably use it then.  Is there any reason you are?\" \"It's refreshing!\" \"Hmmm.\"   I like my dentist a lot.  I'm just not so sure about that hygenist.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...scritch scratch blues...  Jeremy has a bit of a cold, and I believe it may be starting to pass to me.  So far though, I think my latest trend of exercising regularly, and eating a bit healthier than usual may be keeping it at bay.  I have a lot more energy from the workouts...yay!    Today is gray and rainy.  I should really get a job, otherwise I am going to spend my life sleeping late, and padding around the house.  It's just so hard to motivate when the sun doesn't shine.  Blah, blah, blah...:)  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...top of the new year...  I was perusing today's newspaper at our neighborhood coffee shop this morning, when my eyes ran over an article about the possible colon cancer fighting properties of drinking coffee.  Yay!  I knew there had to be something redeeming health-wise with coffee, otherwise why would it taste so damn good!  Before I found myself in the coffee shop, I had been outside walking back from the gas station where I dropped my car.  There is a real light snow lazily making it's way down to earth, and melded pellets of ice coat the sidewalks and trees.  The branches look so beautiful trapped inside those icy shells.  They crack like old bones though, if you run into them.  The holidays were good to us.  We felt fortunate to be able to spend so much time with some family and friends.  Lots of folks in town for awhile.  Lots of good food, though my jeans seem to be more loose than ever...hmmm...unusual.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...glamour nights...  Tonight is the Oscars...I don't know why I love them so much, but I always have.  One year in college I even dragged my small, portable t.v. into the weaving studio so I, and the rest of the ladies, could watch them while working at our looms.   We were going to watch them with Piper and Nick, but when I got home from work Jeremy was ill...sad face for Jeremy.  Nothing drastic, but feeling bad nonetheless.  Friday night while he was working at Muddy's, Jeremy spied Shandi, the local K.C. girl who is currently on America's Next Top Model!  We've been rooting for her, not only 'cause she's from our town, but because she rules!  I missed chatting with her as I was at my Mom's.  Ah well...not a big deal at all.  All of our tickets and lodging are in place for our upcoming trip to New York/London/Swanage!  It will be nice to get away, though I always worry about leaving the kitties.  I think they get sad, and I miss them a lot.  It will be nice to have a few days back in NYC...lots of good folks and memories there.  We are also excited to hang out with Joan and Rachel in their British digs.    I think the weather has taken a turn towards spring!!!  It's been warm for many days, and today it was very windy and rained, but it wasn't too chilly.  C'mon spring!  No more snow!    Lately I've been getting back in touch (or they have been with me) with old friends.  It's nice that you can get back in sync after misplacing them for a couple of years.  I've never enjoyed losing friends...unless they are absolutely wretched, but I don't think I've really had any that I would describe like that.  One last thing...if you ever have the opportunity to do an Ethiopian coffee ceremony, do it!  We were involved in one a couple of weeks ago, and had a grand old time.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...emerging...  Work is good!  Busy bee, busy bee.  I am enjoying my job immensely - the familiar faces who come in, the variety of materials, questions, and having things to do!  Yay this job!  I hope my feelings for it continue in this vein.  It has been a good past week...both Jeremy and I have reconnected with seemingly lost friends, I've started a new book - \"The Shifting Realities of Philip K. Dick: Selected Literary and Philosophical Writings\" and have a couple waiting behind the curtain - \"The Red Tent\" and \"Gravity's Rainbow.\"  The food I've been eating has felt very healthy, and I have been exercising regularly.  We once again have fixings for White Russians in the house.  We had multiple days in a row of 60 or so degree weather...the snow is all gone, and the birds are out in record numbers.  Yesterday at the bank, a gaggle of Canadian geese were taking their sweet time walking along the drive that leads to the teller windows.  I watched a woman just wait helplessly in her car until they meandered past.  They were actually headed for a specific sidewalk, and walked along it, not going into the grass!  Here is a shout out to Morgan...my future neice...Happy Birthday!  You look great for your age!   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...jobby job...  Tomorrow I start my job at Utrecht.  That's right...I got the job.  It will be nice to have money and somewhere to go.  I really need schedules created by someone else to motivate me to use the rest of my time in the most efficient manner.    So Valentine's Day came and went.  Jeremy and I never do tons for it, but we did some chocolate and flowers, and cooked a nice dinner.  It was fun for all.  Nothing much else...for now.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...catch up...ketchup...  Jeremy took me on a date last night to see the final Lord of the Rings movie.  It ruled...all 200 minutes of it!  There is a massive icecicle to the left of our front door.  The whole neighborhood stands in awe of it.  People are making pilgrimages to it just to get a chance for a glimpse.  Well...maybe not pilgrimages...it's an impressive icecicle, okay.  I have a interview with Utrecht art supplies store today.  I have been told that I am the number one candidate, so I may very well have a part-time job soon.  Discount art supplies, whee!  I also dropped off a packet of work last week to a store that carries local artists work.  They don't provide a definite time-line of when they get back to you, so I have no idea.  Keep your fingers crossed they like my stuff.  Yesterdays mail was excellent...Meleah and Peter's wedding invitation arrived.  It was beautiful.  Plus I won a contest and received a $20 gift-certificate to the Majestic Steak House...fortunately they have vegetarian options.  This is the month that Einstein Brothers Bagels has chocolate cherry flavored coffee.  Mmmm...I love it...drool...  Christine and I are continuing our work-out plan, though after our last session I got an incredible urge for a Slurpee...so I got one...but it was the smallest one...and so worth it...mmmm  This weekend I have to start our little brocolli plants inside.  They will hopefully be transplanted into our yet-to-be-dug garden before we leave for England.    I am currently bookless, though I think I am going to start the first Disc World book, and the Lord of the Rings series, and maybe something not so fantastical.  We'll see.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...the best news of all...  The passport arrived yesterday.  In perspective, it was most definitely not the worst thing in the world what happened...there is plenty that is MUCH more frustrating and horrifying.  We have it pretty good.    Anyway...yay, yay, yay!   Here we come NYC, London, and Swanage!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...the passport saga...  So, last Tuesday I flew to Chicago for the day to apply for a rush passport seeing as how someone (I'm thinking the passport agency) lost my previous application.  I had the fun task of stopping a check, reporting a passport lost, and still worrying about all the documents that have all that information \"they\" warn you to guard just floating about somewhere. I flew into Midway, and hopped on the orange line of the L.  I was excited, because I had yet to ride the L in Chicago!  I got to take in the snow that was falling from a very warm, seated position.  I got out at the LaSalle Station, and walked around looking for food, and getting my bearings.  I ended up in a little Middle Eastern cafe, and snacked on some lentil soup and a spinach feta pie while reading my book.  Afterwards, I still had plenty of time until my meeting, but I decided to make my way to the Federal Building anyway, just to locate it.  It was a very short walk...Chicago is pretty easy to get around!  I wandered the blocks surrounding the building looking for someplace warm to hang out.  I ducked into a bookstore for a bit, then found a seemingly fancy Italian cafeteria/espresso bar inside the Bank of America building.  Everyone was a suit...I was not, but didn't care.  I enjoyed a cafe mocha and took in more of my book (which is \"Reading Lolita in Tehran\" by the way...Meade was reading it over Thanksgiving, and I finally picked it up.) After my coffee, I decided it was close enough to the meeting time, so I headed up to the 18th floor of the Federal Building, got my number, and waited to be called up to a window.  I was surprised with how many people there are who need their passports within 14 days.  I made it to a window, shoved all my papers at them, grudgingly wrote a check, and was assured that it would be mailed to me and would probably arrive on Saturday.   Then I gave Meleah a call to just say hi, since I was in her city.  She was on her way to work, but we had a nice chat, filled with much laughter!  After that, I figured I might as well head back to the airport.  I got back on the orange line, and it took me around the whole loop, which was very cool.  I scuttled up to the ticket counter once I made it to Midway, and discovered that I could probably make the 3:00 flight if I hurried, instead of waiting for my 5:00 one.  I took as many moving walkways as I could.  I considered for a minute just waiting for my original flight so I could check out the Ben and Jerry's ice cream parlor, but then I decided I would much rather get back home sooner than later.  So...made the flight, Jer picked me up, we had an early dinner at the Jayhawk, and made it home in plenty of time to catch America's Next Top Model!  As of yesterday, I have still not received my passport!!!  I gave them a ring, and they said that they mailed it that day...by regular mail...not priority...not express...so...I wait, and hopefully it will make it in time for the trip.  If not, we go to New York and hope it arrives with enough time that Johnny can overnight it to us...if not that...then obviously the Gods must not want us to go.  So...I am pretty sure that it will arrive in plenty of time, and we will have a great trip!  Be positive, be positive. If you need a passport, I suggest sending the request many, many months in advance, because they need plenty of time to pull their heads sloooowly out of their asses.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...in the year 2000...  Woah...I haven't written yet in March?  Time is slipping through my fingers, though I don't think I ever had a grasp on it.   Today, after dropping off my car to be worked on (yes, again...there is some sort of high-pitched squeak escaping it) I walked down to McClain's bakery, which has been there since my Mom was a kid.  I needed to go there actually for my Ma...next Friday is her birthday, and Piper, Nick, Daddad, my Mom, Jer, and I are all going to Governor Stumpy's for dinner, then back to our house for cake and presents.  Anyway...I placed an order for her cake and eye-balled all of the other sweets they had for sale...icebox cookies (cherry and regular), fruit bars, cream puffs, macaroons, cupcakes, little pies, m&m cookies, etc.  This started my envisioning what life could be like when we have kids...walking to McClain's for cookies!   So, I exited sans sweets and debated whether I should stop on my way back to the house for coffee from the wonderful Bar Roma (best espresso and coffee outside of Europe ever!!! - the other day I got an iced mocha to die for with their own espresso/vanilla whipped cream on top...sigh) or for a coke from QT.  I opted for coke...couldn't resist that sweet burn, though now I am slightly wishing for coffee.  I took the back way home from QT and transported myself to when our future kids are teens, walking around the neighborhood with sullen looks on their faces.   \"Mom...I'm going to QT for a coke (actually probably for a coke and cigarettes...grrr)\" The back way home is full of chain-link fences, no sidewalks or ones that abruptly end in gravel, utility boxes, rampaging weeds, and weird little businesses.  At least there is no drainage ditch like what was by my house growing up.  I hung out there a lot (unless it was raining...I'm no fool!)  In other news...I'm starting to worry about my passport.  I sent in an application to get a new one in my married name at the start of January, and I've sent them emails twice to check on the status of it...they don't have it in their system...uh...we leave in two weeks!  Please passport gods...let them find it and process it swiftly!!!  I'm going to call them tomorrow and see if they have it yet in their computers, and if not, ask them what I can do.    \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...snippets of life...  Preparing for inventory at work...inventory is tomorrow.  Lazily working on an embroidered present for my pals Meleah and Peter who are getting married a week from today.  Ate some amazing pesto ravioli in a gorgonzola cream sauce the other day.  Replanting an aloe plant that uprooted itself trying to escape us...it didn't get past the front stoop.  Tomato plants sprouting...basil too.  Making preparations for a party.  Writing a note to my future niece...now I just have to mail it.  Launching pills down Frank's throat so his gum infection will clear up.  The color is slowly returning to my arms.  My car started doing this weird vibrate-y thing when I'm stopped...Jer put premium gas and cleaner in the tank today...massage car.  Trying to keep allergies and colds at bay. love.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...chronicle...  part one...i want to wake up in the city that never sleeps...  We arrived at Billie's apartment in the East Village around 9:00pm on Friday the 26th.  The days travels went fairly well, though we had to get put on a different airline due to the fact that we were not notified that our original flight time had changed.  I was about ready to freak, but it all worked out fine.   So...it was great being back in the city!  That first night, after talking with Billie for a bit, Jer and I walked to Odessa...a great 24-hour Ukranian food joint/bar.  We were super hungry...I got the matzoh ball soup and Jer the hot borscht, and we shared sweet potato pierogis and a potato pancake...mmm... The next three days consisted of hanging out with Corrie Beth in Thompkin's Square Park, enjoying the company of the DiCarlos, brunch with lots of family including some cousins!, walking all throughout Central Park until finally arriving at the ice-skating rink to chat with Kuban for a bit, going up into the triple digits for a lovely night of snacking and drinking with Christine and Ron, chats and dinner with Billie, visiting with Bea, clothes shopping, and eating!!!   Tuesday we took a very l-o-n-g subway ride out to JFK and after much line standing, found ourselves on a flight to London...  part two...london calling...  We had never flown Virgin Atlantic before.  Man...I couldn't sleep at all...too many movies and video games to choose from.  It was a good flight, though I regretted not sleeping a little later.  When we deplaned, Jer and I headed for the tube, and then got mixed up in finding our B&B.  Luckily, we finally found someone who busted out a comprehensive map, and directed us to where we needed to go.  I was thankful for finally being able to set down heavy bags. We couldn't check in right away, so we left our bags and decided to grab a bite at a Vietnamese restaurant not too far down the street.  Mmm...I got a bowl of tofu/vegetable Pho (I think it was Pho...maybe Bun) that came with a plate of thai basil, sliced up hot chiles, lime wedges and cilantro to add to my taste.  That, in combination with some jasmine tea, made the shower and sleep that followed all the more sweet.   After a glorious rest, we spent the rest of the night in the room, enjoying British tv, and discovering the tasty sandwiches that one can purchase at Boots. London was a blur of walking to Westminster Abbey, foot pain, expensive yet tasty food, bashing around Brixton, and the start of my love affair with Boots - the best drugstore chain in the universe. Saturday, Joan and Rachel picked us up and we all enjoyed a great day walking the length of the Portabello Road market.  Jer and Rachel had never been there before, and I was happy to have another go at it!  After much walking, we wound our way back to the car, and began our journey to Swanage.  part three...there's corfe castle, i love corfe castle...  The English countryside is beautiful, and I fully enjoyed it from my shotgun seat in Joan's car.  As we found ourselves getting closer to Swanage, I found myself loving all that my eyes were taking in more and more.  We found out as we passed by Corfe Castle (ruins of a medieval - sp?- castle...very cool) that last summer, every time they would drive by there, Morgan would declare, \"There's Corfe Castle!  I lo-ve Corfe Castle!\"  It drove Rachel nuts, so we decided to keep up with the tradition. The night we arrived, we got acquainted with Joan's house, and took a little walking tour of Swanage on our way to eat fish and chips...yes, I ate fish and chips...and it was good!  They are about a five-minute walk from the beach, and can pretty much get anything they need by foot.  The town is all stone, moss, moisture, salt air, and church bells.  I love it! Sunday, we headed to Monkey World (my new home), though Rachel did not join us, for she has been to Monkey World plenty, and had important business to attend to at the arcade...such as the dancing game.  Anyway...Monkey World is a near-by place that takes in all kinds of monkeys who have been rescued from lives that monkeys should not have to lead...such as being photo props, being people's illegal pets, or living in laboratories.  They are given fun indoor/outdoor living spaces, and we are allowed to try to catch glimpses of them playing with their friends, or eating their friends bugs off of their backs.  We saw quite a few, and had a nice time.  As we headed back to the car, the requisite five-minutes of rain for the day came down.  Upon our return, Joan whipped up a super-tasty meal of vegetarian bangers, mashed potatoes, and cabbage, washed down with wine...so good.  Jeremy and I were having a great time hanging out with Joan, but Rachel called and insisted we come to the arcade to meet her mates.  We were game...ha ha. The arcade is a strange mixture of adult gambling machines and various kinds of interactive video games...kid gambling machines!  We met some of Rachel's friends, were ignored, played a basketball game, played the only pinball machine in the place, played air hockey, watched as they all shoved pounds into the dance game (though they are all really quite good at it...I, on the other hand, am not!), were giggled at for snogging, were hugged by Rachel, and were ignored more.  After awhile, we decided to head back. Jeremy started to come down with something, which he is still fighting a bit, so he did not join Joan, Missy (the puppy), and I on our big hike the next day.  It was beautiful!!!  I thoroughly enjoyed the sights, and the company.  Joan made dinner when we returned, and came down with a bug herself soon after.  People were dropping like flies!  She was fairly knocked out for the rest of our stay, though not entirely. Jeremy and I ventured on our own to Corfe Castle.  You can get a steam train from Swanage to Corfe Castle village...about 20 minutes.  We found a nice little tea room to grab a bite of lunch.  While we waited for our order, a poor waiter dropped a tray of glasses, and a bunch of glass flew right onto us, and some other surrounding eaters!  Yikes.  We switched tables after picking the bits of glass from our coats, and were delivered some extremely tasty food.  Jeremy just got some cheese scones with chive butter, and I ordered the vegetable soup with crusty bread...I think that was possibly one of my favorite meals of the whole trip!   Corfe Castle was great fun.  It has amazing views from the top, and I just love hiking around ruins of things.  We walked around the village some before getting the train back to Swanage.  Joan still wasn't doing too hot, so Jer and I headed to a pub for some pints, and some food. Wednesday, our last full day in town, we went to Dorchester, but unfortunately missed the market they have there.  But, we did see some interesting Thomas Hardy related sights, and had fun spending more time with Joan.  That night, all four of us went to an awesome pub in a semi-nearby town.  Very cool. So...Thursday we were driven to Poole, boarded a bus for the airport, got checked through quickly, got on the plane, had food constantly shoved at us, watched two movies, got off in Newark, hopped on the hotel shuttle and enjoyed lolling in our hotel room.  Poor Jer was not feeling well at all.  Fortunately there was a Chinese take-out menu left in our room, so we ordered soup and a spicy tofu dish, which seemed to perk Jer up.   Friday we began the journey back to Kansas City.  The cats were very happy when we came through the front door.  ...a few of my favorite things...  Wellies! - I was wearing Joan's, now I have my own...the view from Joan's guest room window - a full moon illuminating the swift clouds and rooftops - the colors were incredible...English candy bars - we brought many back...crisps - all those flavors...laughing with Rachel...Missy in the kitchen...that wonderful brown bread...walking around with Joan...pints of cider...British news...pulling the chain to flush the toilet...Boots ploughman sandwich!...spending time with friends and family in both New York and Swanage.  ...one last thing...  Since being back, we have been discovering all the secrets of our yard.  We were not here this time last year, so we did not know about the tiny purple and white flowers that are scattered throughout our front yard, how the surprise lillies that came up in the fall have very different looking plants in the spring, or that we have daffodils!     \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...is that all there is?...  My body is full on friends and food.  Tonight I am going to sink into the futon with my embroidery.   Friday we headed out to Excelsior Springs for a party at the Freelings.  They were having a campout, though we couldn't spend the night due to work the next morning.  Here are the things I remember...Mandylan called me on my cell phone, so I talked with her on the crazy, steep, twisty front stairs while cats poked out of the bushes and I stared at the triangular mailbox...devouring a slice of apple pie with homemade vanilla ice cream, followed by a slice of strawberry rhubarb pie...laying by the campfire looking for satellites among the stars...lots of kids running around...drinking wine from the bottle with Jer. Saturday was work is for jerks, but...da da da dum...then came a most fabulous dinner with Christine and Evan over to share in it.  French toast,made with Jer's yummy batter, topped with fresh blueberries, strawberries, apple, banana, and kiwi, plus toasted pecans, honey butter, and powdered sugar.  Drool.  There was also chiken and apple sausage,scrambled eggs donated by Christine's Dad's chickens, and mimosas...then coffee after awhile.  Sigh. Sunday we headed to Lawrence for a BBQ Jenny O. was throwin'.  So much food, and beverage, and...well...it was a Jenny O. party.  It was a fabulous cap to a very filled weekend.  One disappointment though...Amigo's is no longer in Lawrence!  Where is one to get a crisp pinto burrito on their way out of town?!  Highly problematic in the taste bud arena.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...my fellow friends...  Today is the start of my weekend of emptiness...ahhh.   Not that last weekend was bad by any means, just full.  Thursday night I went straight from work to Lidia's Italian Restaurant where Cynthia and Ross's rehersal dinner was taking place.  We snared an invite due to the fact that a couple of days before, Cynthia had called to ask Jer if he could accompany the singer with guitar during the ceremony...she was having a hard time singing acapella.  So, we had a great time...lots of friends, and family (not our own, granted, but it felt close,)and food.  Afterwards, Cynthia, Corrie B, and I spent some time at Broadway Cafe winding down.  Corrie came home with me, as she stayed with us until Sunday! Yay!  Friday was the big day!  I started off the day with two hours at work...woo hoo.  An hour or so later, I was picking up Heather from the airport!  She flew in for the wedding.  We got to Drexel Hall a half hour or so before things started, so Jer could get tuned...I snuck up to visit with all the ladies upstairs.  Cynthia looked fantastic in the dress she had picked out, and Grace, the flower girl, is possibly the devil disguised in the body of a red-headed three-year-old...she's not evil, just mischevious and hilarious!  The ceremony went well...it was elegant, yet relaxed and had laughter.  Dwight Frizzel was the minister, and BCR played at the reception, so it was guaranteed to be interesting!  The reception was fun.  We mainly stuck to our table, because the company was so enjoyable, and the food was...yummy!  Goat cheese and leek tarts, purple potatoes with various toppings, baby vegetables and hummus, roasted garlic, roasted red and yellow peppers, bread, sundried tomato stuff, etc., etc. and the cake...a table of cupcakes and cookies, plus the seven-layer citrus cake...drool...so sweet.  Here's to their happiness!  Saturday was a full day of work, which was followed by an awesome performance of Corrie B and her guitar (and Jer played mandolin and banjo on a few songs!)at the Westport Coffee House.  Her voice...I love it.  She was followed by our pal Laszlo's band The Get Wild Five...yow!  Then they were followed by Ad Astra Per Aspera...always a good time.  I was very tired by the end, so we headed home, but Corrie and Jer hit the after-party at Anthony's.  I mainly did not due to what my plans were for Sunday...  Piper's graduation from Grad School!!!  Yay Piper!  Mom and I went to the ceremony at 10am (ugh)  It was nice, and not too long!  I really enjoyed the guy they gave the honorary degree to.  His speech was great.  At the end of the ceremony they released white doves.  Guess it's better than a bunch of balloons! We swung back by the house to grab Jer and Corrie and food we were taking, then made our way north to Piper and Nick's for a little party.  Good times.  On our way out, we had to say goodbye to Corrie at the airport.  Sigh.  So...that was last weekend...this one looks to be a little more...m-e-l-l-o-w...no work today, Saturday, or Sunday...what's a girl to do?  A shout out to Josh, Julie, and Morgan...congrats on your new living space!!!  Yay for you guys!  I look forward to sending mail to the new address.  We are excited for everything that is happening in your lives.  We love you guys!  Hoping your weekend is m-e-l-l-o-w too.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...yeah, fire! fire!...  Metallica rocked hard last night!  They played Master of Puppets, For Whom the Bell Tolls, One, Search Seek and Destroy, Enter Sandman, Nothing Else Matters, and some newer songs, and other songs I can't recall now.  During many songs there were huge bursts of flames, and firework type things.  We could feel the heat from where we were standing!  I liked watching my Mom throw her hands in the air, and attempt to make the metal horns hand sign (an unknowing tribute to Pan?)  I got a little shiver, though, watching everyone throwing fists in the air and shouting in unison.  It was a little Nazi-esque to me...I couldn't bring myself to do it, at least in rythm with everyone else.  Creepy.  As was the guy who was a racist skin head (nice big swastica tattoo on one arm, and a cross on the other + wearing red suspenders and a bald head.)  He was on the floor, and in the pit the whole show.  He did the ugly mosh pit strut.  Bleh.  Otherwise...plants are transplanted and flourishing, thunder has been rolling across our land for a couple of days - broken up with lots of sunshine, I'm helping out my friend Joscelyn in her studio a bit, Corrie B is coming into town and so is Heather!, the kitties look a little slimmer, Piper is graduating from grad school on Sunday, and...life is good!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...mama mia...  So I'm a day late...nothing new there.  Here's to my Mother.  She's a funny, warm, silly, sensitive woman, who still continues to surprise me.  Plus she is cool as hell...she's taking Piper and I to Metallica tomorrow!  I think she is more excited than I am!  Thanks Mom for all you do.  Also...here's to the other Mom in my life, my Mother-in-law, Joan.  Thank you for your contribution in raising Jeremy, and for the love and support you give us both.  Yay Moms!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...sizzlin...  Our upstairs is hot!  That is where the computer is...my brain is working s-l-o-w-e-r in the heat...must have water soon.  Meleah and Peter's wedding was a hit!  We danced like crazy and I drank much more than I normally do...tried a Colorado Bulldog...yummy...it's: equal parts Bailey's, vodka, and Kahluha, then you put a little milk/half&half (whatever you prefer) and top it off with a splash of coke...try it...now!  Anyway...I wasn't exactly hung over the next morning, but upon rising, I decided I needed to sit upstairs a bit, drink some water, and eat some crackers before I could get on with my day.   Congratulations Peter and Meleah!  I love you guys.  So, that day after the wedding, we had a little May Day/Cinco de Mayo throw down.  Overall it went well.  Make your own tacos, sangria, and cookies is what we provided, and others brought shrimp, chicken enchiladas, tamales, and I don't know what else!  I did not drink anything stronger than Mexican coke (it's sweetened different!)  Late into the night, things got a little rowdy, but we won't go into that.  I got the pleasure of working the next day, but it wasn't bad...Monday I got a weird 24-hour bug, that made me sleep a lot, and when I was awake, burp and fart much.  It could have been much worse I suppose.  I thought after this past weekend that things were slowing down for awhile...hahaha...how foolish. It's good though.  Next week is Metallica with my Mom and sister!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...raindrops keep falling on my head...  We had a mini-vacation of camping this past weekend, for Evan and Christine's bachelor/bachelorette party.  It was at the same group site by Clinton lake that Jer and I had our b/b party at two years ago! Here is a perfect example of how nice Jer is...Friday he arrived at the campground around 4:00 to pick up the key to the gate.  I could not leave until 8:00 due to working, so I didn't even arrive until close to 9:30.  Jeremy knew approximately when I would get there, so he had food on the grill for me that was ready about 10 minutes after my arrival!  Plus the tent was all set up (though we ended up experimenting with sleeping in the truck that first night...quite cozy.)  What a sweetheart.  It was a good trip, though we got rained on heavily Sunday morning...kind of a bummer way to end a nice weekend, but it worked out.  The rest of the time was gorgeous and there was swimming, night sailing, crazy kids running around, fires, smores, drunken 14-year-old antics, who-can-hold-their-hand-in-ice-longer competition (I was part of that...I can get a little competitive), much eating of food (there was even pork satay with peanut sauce + roasted jalapenos courtesy of Noy and Aaron!), funny campfire conversations, ticks, and much, much more.   Otherwise...Jer and I are up to the usual.   The anniversary celebration was a sucess!  We stuffed ourselves at La Bodega on tapas (I even tried anchovies!), beverages (port for Jer, wine for me), dessert (the best flan ever!!! + pear tart), and coffee (regular 'ol coffee for the Mr. and flaming Spanish coffee for myself...invision a sugar rimmed glass filled with Bacardi 151, set on fire, then having cinnamon sprinkled into the flames...they are extinguished by coffee, kahluha, and whipped cream...then it is devoured by a roly-poly Stacy.)  Mmm...  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...brown is the colour of my true love's hair...  Two years ago today it was HOT, but I didn't care, because Jeremy and I were trading rings, and we were surrounded by friends and family.  Part of me can't believe it has already been two years, while the other part feels, \"It's only been two years?!\"  A lot can go on in that time...  I cannot imagine a better partner than Jer.   You are my best friend, my lover, and I would not trade you for anything!  I love you, Jer.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...what...  Since I was last here... Rick, Jer's Dad, came for a visit.  We had a very pleasant time with him - talking, watching movies, cooking, eating, talking some more.  Though the trip proved not to be the best thing for his health, we still enjoyed that he made it to visit us, saw the house, and met my Mom and some of our friends.  We truly had a good time hosting him.  The rains have been drowning us, but the plants seem to appreciate it.  A guy Jer works with is convinced it is the weather planes run by corporate America doing it...I don't know...I think it's just a rainy season.    My car rolled over 100,000 miles yesterday!  It's been all over the U.S. ...to some places multiple times, and yet it is still running (though still chuggy chuggy at stops, and having a slow go of speeding up from stops, but still running!)  I am excited to receive my new car,but how can I say goodbye to my transportation for the last nine years?!  Wow...I'm really attached to an inanimate object.    I've been embroidering floral patterns made out of human bone shapes on to tissue paper.  Delicate work.  A belated, public Happy Birthday announcement to my sister Piper, and to my almost sister-in-law Julie.  Julie is one day older than Piper!  How bizzare.  Both are off traveling, and having a good time of it I'm sure.  Also...a belated birthday greeting to Rick!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...long distance birthing celebration...  HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my sister-in-law Rachel!!!&nbsp; She turns the big 1-5 today.&nbsp; Rachel...I don't even know if you read this, but Joan can tell you...we will be sending a present to the house in Detroit, and we are attempting to call or email today.&nbsp; Just know that Jeremy and I are thinking of you, and hoping you have a super-fun birthday!&nbsp; We love you lots.  ...in other news...  How fitting that today, exactly one year from my father passing away, that I would get a call from the Toyota dealership saying I could pick up my Prius this Saturday.&nbsp; It is fitting due to the fact that I am able to get it through money inherited from my Grandparents through my Dad, plus my Grandfather and my Dad both had a love of cars, and fine machinery.&nbsp; So...in honor of them, I will be dubbing my new car...Dr. Wilson (Grandpa was an actual Dr. and my Dad was a PhD.)&nbsp; Look for me cruisin' the streets of K.C. (in an environmentally responsible way) starting Saturday!&nbsp; The Dr. is in, be-atch! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...kinda technical...

VOTE!!! It could very well get nasty here in Missouri today...hopefully we will NOT vote in Ammendment 2 (which will write into the constitution of Missouri that marriage is between a man and a woman so those \"activist\" judges can't say otherwise.)  There is also a vote to build a downtown arena in K.C. (and taxes would not be raised to do it.)  I guess that's okay...I wish they would put in a giant ferris wheel like London instead.  Now that would be cool!!!   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      ...a whole lot of buzzing goin' on...  Saturday afternoon I entered my studio in search of an old sketchbook when a buzz near the window distracted me.  I looked over, expecting to see a large housefly trapped on the wrong side, but instead there was a wasp hovering above the window frame right by a NEST!  As one can imagine, I quickly exited the room and shoved towels around the edges.  Tonight, Evan and Christine came over to pick up their tents that were drying in our backyard, and Evan sprayed the hell out of that nest with noxious chemicals.  Tomorrow we are going in and removing the window air conditioning unit, and later will take down the devestated nest.  Ugh.  On top of that, I feel itchy all over due to bug bites and keep searching the ceiling of every room for signs of unwanted insect life.  Otherwise...I brushed a kittens worth of fur out of Frank's coat the other day, Christine made her delicious tortilla soup last night and I got to come over and enjoy it! (Jer had to work...she sent some home for him), heirloom tomatoes are highly tasty - in particular Cherokee purples, I ate a little strawberry from our yard today, the Prius is fun to drive in - especially when it is silent, rosemary infused strawberry lemonade is...fantastic!   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n\r\n</Blog>",

Karaoke at the Grille on Saturday.&nbsp; I sang  Mack the Knife ,  Baby Got Back  (which I dedicated to \"those who couldn't come\"), and  Jenny(867-5309) .&nbsp;  Connor, aka Frank the Tank,&nbsp;lost in a beer chugging contest&nbsp;with a girl!&nbsp; Actually, that was pretty odd, and her friend poured some beer on him...go figure.  Crazy drunk lady followed us home...kind of freaky...  Texas Hold 'Em, everyday!&nbsp; I won once, ended up +$10 on the weekend.&nbsp; Duda was the big winner after he scored the $200 pot on Sunday.&nbsp;   Keg of Michelob Light.&nbsp; Not quite Killians, but we all know what that does to people...we really don't need any holes in the wall...  Jamming on  Feelin' Alright  with Ludwin and Eli.&nbsp; Rocked out tune.  The numerous random Old School quoting, like when Ludwin popped in on Duda and I around 3 a.m. and yelled, \"Hey everybody, we're going streaking!&nbsp; C'mon.....we're going streaking down through the quad!\"   Quality stuff.&nbsp;  urlLink Check out the pics here .   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Winners get an autographed Wilson Alvarez baseball, circa 1998!

I've come to the conclusion that Bill Engvall is correct. Stupid people  should  have to wear signs that say \"I'm Stupid\" (or in my case identify themselves over the phone).   I'm waiting with baited breath for football season to start. I've got a rabid Fins fan here in the department, who I can't wait to start talking trash to when they start their November slide. We should have some fun October when the J-E-T-S, JETS, JETS, JETS! come to town...  I'm getting a little antsy over the day-to-day battle for the NL East lead between  four  teams. These teams either need to start winning some games and make a run for it, or they need to just quit. I can't take this four-way race for much longer. At least four of the teams in that division are competitve, which is more than I can say for their AL counterparts - no offense meant to those of you who follow the O's and the Sox, but until either some team&nbsp;takes the crown from the 'Axis of Evil', or Satan himself comes to&nbsp;take his team back to the nether-regions, that division will never be competitive.  I have two favorite teams in baseball: the Mets and whoever is playing the Yankees.  For those of you in Tally, my family and I are going to try to plan a trip up there to see a game sometime in October or November probably. Looking forward to possibly seeing everyone. If anyone is in the South Florida area, give me a call: (561) 339-4903. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      I just got here to Maine, and my aunt Janet and aunt Linda go, \"Hey, your birthday gift is in the fridge!\"&nbsp; I open the white fridge to find two cases of Killian's Red.&nbsp; All for me.&nbsp; My  MOM  ordered the keg for Friday night!&nbsp; Uncle Nick picked out the beer!&nbsp; Dad brought two cigars to have a celebratory smoke.&nbsp; Truly, the best family a guy could ask for. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Check 'em out.    urlLink Four's Pictures from Haiti     \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      That's right.&nbsp; I know you can all remember the dude in the big velvet hat sliding across the room.&nbsp; Don't deny it - you liked that song.&nbsp;   Anyway, things are just about as busy as possible, between trips to Haiti, Maine, and Vermont (Phish!) and the incredble amount of business, I just can't keep up.&nbsp; Lest we forget July 28th, my birthday.&nbsp;   Got to hang with the Aces on Sunday evening,&nbsp;and I brought up some of the Cohibas I had acquired in Haiti.&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp; I must say, their house is quite nice, and Ace gets MAD PROPS for the 50 in.

The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office was searching this afternoon for a tiger that escaped from a private residence in Loxahatchee.  The big cat was reported missing around 3 p.m. from a residence in the 3600 block of C Road, sheriff's office spokesman Paul Miller said.  The sheriff's helicopter was searching from the air while other specialists searched on the ground.  I wonder how much these \"specialists\" got paid...or how much experience they really have. Did they just get Billy and Joe Bob out there with their hunting gear (can't forget that safety orange vest)?  ...here's your sign...\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      I'm here at the hotel.  I'd like you all to try and imagine a place with thousands of people hanging out in the streets, shanty towns, no street lights, no stop signs, and crazy people driving.  Our driver (an ex-secret service agent) basically helped us avoid death on multiple occasions.  The mountains here, however, are incredible.  The views are the stuff of traveler's dreams.  The hotel is nice, and I am getting a box of Cuban cigars tomorrow.  I'm basically in between excited, afraid, and tired.  Oh, I forgot - the airline lost our luggage, and it won't be here until tomorrow.  Good job American Airlines...\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      That's right kids... Spence finally got blogger to fix whatever the hell was keeping me away from the Gut Box (makes me wonder if Erin is trying to keep me away from anything Guthrie's related...  just kidding... she loves that little hell-hole of great food as much as I do... well almost as much.)  As far as the poker fad goes... it is fun to see everyone starting to catch on to it, makes it much easier to get a game and to take stupid people's money...  Now if I could just figure out when I have some time to actually play...    Four - good luck in Haiti man.  Remember, tell your captors whatever they want to hear.  They'll go easier on you. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,August,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Not much going on here.

I'll be working for ComCEL, a division of Western Wireless International, LLC.  We're implementing their POS system, with a new integration NTG is designing for activation and tracking of ESNs.  I'm staying at the  urlLink Villa Creole Hotel , which has satellite TV and high speed internet, even in the \"standard\" rooms.    I really don't know why this trip seems so exciting - most people freak out when I tell them where I'm going.

Not bad, especially since I was watching it with my dad and everytime Ahnold came on screen he went \"it's the Gubernator!\"  He thought it was funny the 500th time he did it, I didn't...  One movie I have marked on my calender as a no-miss is  Anchorman .  I mean, how could anyone pass that one up?  Will Ferrell is simply comic genius.  The bottom line is who else can say  \"I wrote this song about the time I killed a drifter to get an erection\"  and make you laugh?    Finally, the big day is approaching...July 28th.  Spence, I saved the margarita set you gave me for Christmas, and I am busting it out that day.

Except the times when it comes out messy and without form, which I do not enjoy.  I always thought my dog's name was just a big joke but it turns out that it fits him perfectly.  I look forward to getting an underground fence at my new home and watching my little JackAce learn the fence limits over and over again - maybe it'll be like Electric-Shock Therapy and he'll calm down a bit.  Doubtful.  He's biting me right now . . . I just bit him back.  I'm glad dogs don't have souls, because I would hate to think my dog would be going to hell.  Don't get me wrong though, I love my little JackAce - I just feel there's room to love him more.  I've heard a puppy is good training for a baby.  I hope not.

Speaking of music, I'm looking forward to the Phish concert next week.  In northern Vermont, and called \"Coventry\", it's a four day campout/concert which is the final performance of my favorite band.  I have a feeling it'll be the greatest show I've ever seen.

Part of me is sad to see the guy go - he's always been a personal favorite.  However, sitting out that game at Yankee stadium a few weeks back, turning down the Sox's offer of a 4 year, $60 million dollar deal, begins to make me doubt his passion and loyalty.   Of course the sting might still have been there after the failed A-Rod deal, but Manny has dealt with it pretty well, and that happened  after  Nomar turned down the original offer, which was pretty generous considering his second half production was pitiful.  Thoughts, anyone?      \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n\r\n</Blog>",

Saw a pretty hot looking gal in the gym there that made me work out that much harder but now im feeling the pain and kinda regretting it :( after that went to watch Bend It Like Beckham , pretty funny movie but the shittiest thing happened while we were watching the show this kid sneaked up to our row peeked at us and went back to his friends and they all started giggling like the idiots they were .....anyway they were sec school kids so i figured no point confronting them .....but it really pissed me off .ok later i got to go sign up for my advanced thery test but just damm lazy to go cos no one is at home so just feel like lazing ard at home with no one to nag at me ........oh well maybe i will go to the library instead much nearer ...see how lah .......damm i got to stop typing \"......\" ......ok thats all i got to say now .......\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Just Saw the sadddest movie i seen in a while ...Its Dancer in the Dark starring one of my fav musicians bjork.Thanks to my recently acquired broadband connection i manage to dl it although it took me like a week! anyway the wait was well worth it cos the movie is really something, bjork plays this factory worker from czechklosvakia who is losing her sight , its hereditary , so shes saving up money for an operation for her son so that he wun go blind as well. To escape this grim reality she daydreams that she is in a musical becos like she says , \"nothing bad happens in a musical\". halfway during the movie a quick succession of tragedies occur and her life rapidly takes a turn for the worse and her daydreams become more and more frequent cos thats the only way she can cope with them. The ending is really tragic and I couldnt help letting out a tear or two , it was just that painful to watch. I read that when this picture was awarded Best Picture at 2000 Cannes festival (Bjork got Best Actress) there were people who booed and jeered , cant really understand why !  I downloaded A Clockwork Orange yesterday gonna watch it later .....well nothing else to do also ......\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      How can a gal who once made me as happy as i can remember,  now can cause me such misery and pain? There was a time not too long ago when i couldnt wait to see or talk to her, i thought abt her all the time. Now all she seems to do is put me down , tell me how irritating i am or how sick she is of me .....I wish i never met her ....But anyway she is out of my life for good now , and vice versa. Only thing i have left of her is the book she lend me, its gonna be a painful reminder of what i went thro with her everytime i look at it. \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Damm Man Utd lost again ! wtf man they are playing like crap and I almost cried when i saw Barthez flapping his arms like a dying bird trying to get to a cross , he is really out of form rite now. and the rest arent really much better , every promising attack broke up in the final third of the field and bloody nisterooy is like a big baby who keeps complaining to the referee everytime he falls to the ground, i mean get with the game man ! Hope Fergurson does something really soon or we might see the team failing to even get a top 3 position.\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      So had a pretty cool birthday yesterday, wati took me out for a nice dinner at delifrance and to watch Road to Perdition. And she even bought me a beautiful pen shes such a sweet person ! The movie was excellent, and it was really refreshing to see Tom Hanks take on a role of someone who is so bent on revenge that he doesnt care who he kills to get it, there was one scene where i was pretty sure he wouldnt kill the guy so i was kinda surprised when he did. However , i still prefer his previous feature American Beauty which i watched a few days ago, it was really funny and also every character in the movie was really engrossing to watch with their own little quirks. \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      This is my new blogchalk:   Singapore, Singapore, Chai Chee, English, Gilbert, Male, 21-25, Metal/Indie Music, Movies.   :)\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Yesterday was my convocation , and it was pretty cool , i thought i looked pretty cute in my pretty convocation gown ! Took loads of pictures , ok not loads around 20+ pics with my friends and my parents. And I wanted to take this picture with this cute gal that i had a crush on couple years back but unfortuantely she kinda asked my other friend to join us i the pic damm ! oh well no worries i will just have to cut him out of the pic after i develop it *snicker* ....But i was really stressed the day b4 cos i couldnt find the damm convocation tickets and i was like turning the house upside down looking for them. Luckily i realised i left it at my sis's place so had to travel all the way there and back to get them ,took me like 3 hours ...sigh i dun know why i always do stuff at the last minute. And then i found out my mom forgot to sow the hooks on my gown and that got me even more stressed out cos i asked her to do it like 2 days ago ....Fortunately everything turned out fine in the end  Ok today is my bday , yup im 24 ...24 that seems so old yet i still feel like im 18 or something ......I mean i still wear the same type of clothes i did when i was 18 , ok maybe they are more tasteful now but still ard the same. No big plans for today , just gonna see Road to Perdition later with a gal friend of mine, heard its a great movie but damm couldnt they have chosen a better movie title or something ?  I downloaded and watched american beauty at ard 1 am in the morning and i loved it ! It was so engrossing and Kevin Spacey was really awesome as this burnt out 40 something husband guy with a really dsyfunctional family , his wife is so driven by success and material things that she totally ignores her family , and the daughter is so embarassed by him and his wife that she starts having a relationship with her creepy neighbour who films her every move...only complain i had was that spacey kind of gives away at the beginning of the movie that he was going to die , the ending would have been much more dramatic if i didnt know that.    \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Monday morning and i had to go to the hospital for my skin problem. Got totally ripped off they took skin samples and did tests and all that crap and then came to the conclusion that i had dry skin and send me home packing with 2 jars of moisturers, what a total rip off cos it cost me $150 altogether.  Other than that it was a pretty uneventful day, came back home and played CM for the whole afternoon, checked on my online job sites for any job vacancies but still no luck. Sigh i wonder how long its gonna take its been like 3 months already and i feel guilty sucking my parents dry of their money. Just my luck that i had to graduate from university in the middle of our country's worst economic recession, or at least the worst that I can remember.   Oh yeah downloaded another couple of tracks from the Queens of the Stone Age's new album Songs for the Deaf, this is really amazing stuff, best music i have heard this year. Hope to get my hands on the CD soon so i can play it on my hi-fi, listening to it on the computer just ain't the same thing. btw an interesting fact abt the Queens is that Dave Grohl is their new drummer and he does an awesome job. I never thot i would be into this kind of classic rock stuff but i guess im just really sick of nu metal rite now , most of the bands out now sound so generic and lacking any sort of passion in the music they play. Except Korn though, Untouchables rules !!! But Linkin Park, Limp Biskit and all that other crap i just hope they die out soon.    Albums I listened to today on my hi-fi:  1. Toxicity by System of a Down  2. Untouchables by Korn  3. Sources Codes and Tags by Trail of Dead  4. XX by Mushroomhead  5. Is This It by the Strokes \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Ok it has been a pretty interesting week.....nope actually it was really crappy. The first gal i ever met off the net basically told me i creeped her out; yeah life doesn't get any better than that does it. Apparently i was invading her personal space and our meetings were very 'unnatural' and she said i assumed that she wanted to be friends in real life as well when she actually didnt.  Well here is the thing, after we met for the first time, i wasn't going to ask her or anything cos i thot it went pretty badly, She was the one who called me and asked me to go out with her again; so im kinda confused - if she just wanted to be online friends why the hell did she ask me out again ? and also why did she meet me again for breakfast after that? and also the last time we met she actually was suggesting going to play badminton; if it was that unnatural why would she even do that it just doesnt make any sense and yeah its been picking on my brain the last week. But I do not want to ask her about it cos it would probably make things weirder than they are.  But cant help having this feeling of regret cos i really liked her, she was this gal who went thro and still going thro a lot of crap in her life and is now a lot stronger for it, shes totally supporting herself eventhough shes studying which is much more than what i can say for my unemployed ass, and also a really kind gal who cares for others, i mean when she spend like 30 bucks on a birthday present for the kid she was giving tuition to, i was really impressed, it's probably something that i would never do. Basically she made me want to be a better person. Oh well thats life ain't it, just full of weirdos(i mean me) and disappointments \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      A friend of mine failed her driving test today and she seems really upset over it. She was saying how nothing seemed to go right for her and i can really relate to that; thats what i was feeling a week ago. Anyway because of my 'honesty first' phase right now i think i kinda made her feel worse damm someone warned me it would backfire on me but i wouldn't listen. I think when pple are depressed abt something they would rather hear consoling words than honest words.\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Was reading the classifieds today and there was this letter in the forum sent in by this Malay gal complaining about her frustration in getting a job because so many of them required Mandarin, and she basically called it subtle discrimination. Well I have been complaining to everyone about this for a few months now and i know how she feels but hey thats how the world works. Ya it fucking sucks but there is nothing you can do about it. Her letter is not going to like change that.    \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Got this really weird letter from the army. It basically said that I have been posted to the G2 Branch of HQ 9DIV as an \"Interrogator classified under Interrogation Cell\" and that I have to attend this 'MI Course' on the 28th of April. Ya i got no idea what the hell it means either.  Met up with Wee at Bedok today, i was so tempted to tell him how much i hated the fact that he got into NCS but not me, but manage to supress it though. We talked for like an hour and a half and he drove me back home, sweet fellow...  Got an email from Roxy today, man its been so long since i talked to her so i was really glad that she emailed me. Haven't seen her online for such a long time that i was actually getting worried that something was wrong and was thinking of emailing her. It's pretty scary when you got no idea what happened to a net friend you have known for a while.  Lana Lang from Smallville is such a babe, I think it's her eyes, they just drive me wild ! \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      I don't know why i get so serious and uptight when it comes to net conversations. Yesterday i finally confessed to a net friend that i didnt like the fact that she kept replying to my messages with frivolous messages like \":)\" or \"hehe\" and that i didn't like it because it made the conversations feel very one sided (as i was doing all the talking) and that i would rather hear her thoughts and opinions on what i say. I hope she wasn't too offended about it but i think she was. Oh well...  Another thing that I really dislike is people who take too long to reply. Ya i know its weird but it pisses me off. And i also get irritated when pple just go offline without giving me a chance to say bye. For me a net conversation is no different from a phone conversation. On the phone you say \"bye\" and wait for the other person to say \"bye\" before you hang up. But some of my net friends just say bye and go offline without giving me a chance to say bye as well. I mean it's like they are in such a rush that they can't even wait an extra minute for me to reply, whats up with that !. Ya i know i'm probably being a little too weird about this but i can't help it, thats how i feel.   I think the reason why i'm so uptight about net conversations is probably cos , as sad as it sounds, the only social interaction that i have right now. My social life is practically non-existent right now and its been even worse since i graduated. When i was studying i was too busy with school work and all that to really think abt my lack of a social life. But now that i got so much time on my hands, i realise how lonely my life is right now. And i also realised that i have not felt happy in a really long time, but i was too busy with school and stuff to realise it before. \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      A net friend told me something that was really private today. And as much as i appreciated the fact that she trusted me with that thing and i know i wouldn't betray her trust, i think it was kind of risky to do that cos the person who you know online might not be the real deal, like he/she might not be as trustworthy as you think he/she is and it would be really bad if he or she betrays that trust. As much as we would want to believe it, not everyone we meet are good people.    A few days ago i came to the realization that i read too much into my friendship with Sharon than I ought to have. She was treating me just as a casual friend but i was thinking we were closer than that and that was how all the problems started. I guess I felt that way because she was telling me some really personal problems that she was having at that time so i believed that she was telling them to me because she felt a connection to me. But now i realise that she did that cos its much easier to tell someone online your personal problems as compared to someone that you know in real life. Maybe its because a real friend has a much greater potential to hurt you with that knowledge compared to a net friend.   It's 2:35 AM now and i think i'm gonna go to sleep.  \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Ok so i told the online friend that she is the one i wanted to go out with, and i think she was taken aback a little. Anyway i hope she doesn't take it too seriously, i mean its not like I'm looking for a gf or a relationship cos thats the last thing that i want right now, all i wanna do is go out and hopefully have a good time. I really hope things dun go weird between us because of this cos it would really really suck if it did.   Just saw Boston Public at an ungodly hour of 12:30 and well it was kinda boring not really memorable. I thot the whole class project involving the students suing Lipsihtz was kinda silly and not really believable, despite my lack of knowledge of the American judicial system i dun believe such a thing would be possible in real life. I think the series should just focus on real life social issues that are more believable.  It's 2:14 AM now and i think i'm gonna go to sleep. \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Just came back from Somerset, but the control they gave me was a different model from the one that i gave them and i forgot to check when i got it , fuck i hope it works cos i definitely do not wanna go down all the way back there again.  But it was a rather interesting trip, at least more interesting than i thought, at the mrt station there were these 2 old ladies who were heading towards the escalator that is going upwards towards the train and for some weird reason they were changed their mind and headed towards the escalator that is going downwards from the train which of cos they couldnt take,and then they came back to the escalator heading upwards again and took it. Please God kill me b4 i start doing senile stuff like that !   While waiting for the train, I sat beside a man who lifted his foot from his sandal and playing around with it , i''m serious ! It seems like he was like digging under his toenails for dirt or something it was just so damm gross ! Damm there's weird people everywhere!   Then in the train as i was sitting down this Indian gal sitting opposite of me started staring at me and i was like wondering why the hell she was doing that, i thought she was checking me out which would be probably the first time a gal ever did that to me! But then i realised that she did seem somewhat familiar but i just couldn't remember who she was. Finally it came to me that she was my distant cousin that i haven't seen in like god knows how many years . Anyway i went over and said hi and it was kinda nice you know, i mean talking to a member of the opp. sex after such a long time in captivity (i mean my home). But then i had to get off cos it was my stop and didn't have time to get her handphone number.   I been wanting to go out with this net friend of mine cos we been talking for quite a few months now and i think we get along pretty well so maybe we could like go out for a movie or something. But the problem is i already asked her once and got rejected so there is no way in hell im gonna ask her again. Anyway in my opinion i dun see whats the big deal cos in the worst case scenario if the date goes really badly we can always just laugh abt it online the next day rite , and if it goes well then we have fun. Oh well....\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Murphy's Law : Things only get lost when you are looking for them.

Well like i told her , I suddenly just feel the need to write down all my thoughts, uncut and uncensored, dun ask me why i also dun know! I don't know how long i'm gonna do this so to the people who do read this blog (yes all 4 of you), just hang on for the ride ! BTW think i shall change the description of my blog to \"Ramblings of a bondafide madman\" ..I dun know what the hell bonafide means but it sure does sound cool doesn't it ! : ) \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      I was reading Audrey's new blog yesterday and got the shock of my life when she mentioned that my blog was really funny ! LMAO That would be like the last word i would use to describe my blog .....But she seems like a pretty cool and fun gal, and those pictures she gave me of her and her cousins in the changing room were pretty cool..And nope i know what you guys are thinking, they were all fully clothed. : (     Woke up this morning to the loud din of my mom's voice complaining to my dad abt something i dun quite remember, its amazing that im in my room and shes in the kitchen and i still can hear her thats how loud her voice is. I think its a trait of older Indian women...Even in the tamil movies those Indian women talk so fucking loud that i just have to switch to another channel.   Gotta go down later to Somerset to change the remote control for my auntie's cable TV.  I kept putting it off cos its damm fucking far you know and its kinda dumb just going down to town just to change a stupid remote control, i was waiting for a day where I was going there to watch a movie but then my dad started giving me the speech abt how our auntie helped us so much in the past and how we should be grateful and all that and i just started getting really sleepy so I just cut him off and told him i will be going today. Heh he was kinda pissed abt me cutting him off but he didnt say anything cos well i agreed to do what he said rite !    Read the funniest thing in today's newspaper. The PAS, which is the ruling party in the state of Kelantan are thinking of relaxing polygamy rules in the state because get this , \"to solve the problem of single mothers \" and that this women need \"companionship and love\" !! LOL Oh god have you heard anything more sexist in your life ? And of course this has absolutely NOTHING to do with the fact that 2 state ministers were caught practicing polygamy illegally in the state recently. And then they try to justify it by saying they will whip any person who like abuses the law for the purposes of lust! Like HELLO what other reason do you think they will do it for ? Cos they really wanna help with the problem of single mothers in the state? YA right and im not handsome !    Listening to Beck's Odelay right now, I think its like probably like the hippest record i got in my collection, makes me shake my body uncontrollably whenever i listen to it and now i got it turned it up all the way to 12 on my hi-fi which believe me is damm fucking loud. Ahh the things you can do when you parents aren't around ....  Two of my friends just got into NCS (national computer systems) and im really happy for them..NOT! Fuck I'm better than them when it comes to programming skill, they know it and I know it and it pisses me off that they got in while i didnt even get a call to come down for a bloody interview!  Yeah i know how un-PC it sounds ok but thats what im feeling rite now so screw PCness !  Ok got to head down to somerset now to get that stupid remote control now !  \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Ok just came back from the library at tampines. Went there to relax but instead (like everything else in my life right now) the exact opposite happen . So i was at the library looking for this book by Neil Gaiman which  urlLink Di  recommended called Coraline but when I got there i couldnt find the piece of paper which i wrote the name of the author so i had to sms her and get it from her ...ok so small glitch , then when i finally found the section where his books were, i couldnt find it! crap when i checked at home at the library website there were 3 available copies ! Anyway i looked around for like 20 minutes or so and finally gave up and just borrowed another book by him called smoke and mirrors and looked for another book to borrow. And then this pair of secondary students sitting on the floor in between the bookshelves basically blocking the already narrow aisle and that really pissed me off, i was thinking \"why dun you move fucking further apart so that u block more of the aisle and no one can walk in at all?\" Anyway  i just stood there and stared at them and i guess they got the hint cos they stood up and got out of there.  Oh yeah and then there was this group of secondary school gals who were like giggling the whole time in the library which even pissed me off more. Fuck, what is it with secondary school gals and giggling , why is everything so damm funny to them, i mean do you see secondary school guys grouping together and giggling like a bunch of idiots, i dun think so!   And then comes this announcement over the library PA that the library is closing at 5 pm and im like totally confused, what the hell i just got here 1/2 an hr ago!! Can't they just standardise the closing times for all the different library branches instead of confusing us like that by having different closing times for different branches !!  Anyway i borrowed a flash/dreamweaver and a C++ book and got out of there and headed back home.  And then on the MRT i had the damm good luck of sitting beside a boy who, in my humble opinion, should have been born a monkey cos he couldnt stop swinging on those handrails on the train and making really dumb ass irritating noises that were really driving me crazy. And his bloody parents encouraged him even more !!! I was honestly praying to God that the little monkey would fall and hit his head and start crying cos if that had happened i would have laughed my ass off i tell ya!   But as usual i didnt get what i want. \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Jiaqi asked me to go to a Halloween party on thursday..now the only problem is finding a party to go to, i mean there has to be some club in town that is holding one of those right.... yeah i know i hate clubbing but i think just need one night to like totally go crazy and wild , besides if im wearing a costume dun need to worry abt making a fool of myself cos no one would regconize me ...who knows i might even get some ..ya ok maybe i should like get back to reality now.   Just download Coldplay's new album and listening to it, its pretty good so far gotta give it a few more spins, but it just reminds me of Radiohead's Bends a little too much , you know the acoustic guitar, the falsetto lead voice basically everything! \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Saw the Crossroads ep. of 6 Feet Under and got like a huge shock of my life. I was still getting used to seeing the lead actor kissing another guy in the past episodes and suddenly i get hit with male FULL FRONTAL NUDITY. And we are not talking abt like 1sec it was like 20 secs or something cos he was talking to Nate in that naked state. Sheesh you hardly see full frontal in movies nowdays so i hardly expected it in a tv series. And also it made me feel kinda inadequate : ( ...nah im kidding !  but its too bad the lead actor (whats his name again) broke up with Keith, he was quite a nice guy and pretty good looking also ....hmm i think i better stop now im kinda scaring myself ! \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Oh i talked to my friend and he told me he only paid 300++ for his graduation studio pictures. I paid ard 1k. Can anyone say RIPPED OFF . Well they did provide really good service for me like buying packet drinks for me and holding open the door as i left the studio so that accounts for a little of the 700 dollars difference .... *Bert trying to justify the cost*   Got into an argument with my dad just now, he keeps telling me to go sign up for the driving lessons but the fucking problem is we dun have enough money! I already told him it will cost around 2k which i know he doesnt have but he keeps telling me to find out if i can pay like per lesson. Either way it costs ard 2k what so whats the fucking diff ! If you dun have the money you dun have the money ....Anyway im not gonna argue with him im gonna go down later and just get all the info from Ubi Driving Centre then just let him do what the hell he wants.  \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      I'm so in love with Six Feet Under, probably one of the best series I can remember watching in recent years. It just keeps getting better and better with each episode and keeps turning out surprises when you least expect it, will not go into details cos I don't wanna give anything away. I just finished watching the 6th episode and now dl the 7th. At this rate i'm probably gonna finish the whole series by the end of the week. For those who do not know the series is about a family who runs a mourtuary home,  and tthe head of the household the father passed away recently and about the remaining members trying to get on with their lives. Its like totally funny at times and yet can be really sad and poignant at others. The characters lead pretty dsyfunctional lives but i can really relate to them. \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Ben just told me he got a new girlfriend, and its obvious how happy he is right now. I'm really happy for him but have to admit I'm a bit envious. Not because I dun have a girlfriend, but because i haven't felt happy in a really long time. The last time i can remember feeling that way  was when I was with her. I really miss that feeling.  In the last week i broke down and cried twice, and the worst thing is I dun even know why i did. Am i losing my mind? Maybe its because of her, maybe its because im no closer to getting a job now then when i first started looking and i dun know why that is. I have no idea. But I've been feeling this sense of hopelessness that I just can't shake off. I just dun know whats my purpose in life anymore. \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Ok haven't really updated my blog in a while so i better get right to it!  SO what did I do today ...hmm ya almost got into a car accident thats what , thanks to Hafeez! I dun have a licence but this was the scenario: He was going to turn left into a carpark but there was a bus at the bus stop just b4 the carpark so he just went to the 2nd lane and turned into the carpark from the 2nd lane. At the same time he turned the bus started to move off and it almost hit us as we turned into the carpark , he did signal but i dun know he didnt slow down or anything , so who's fault was it ? Anyway it was kinda scary...  Anyway we went to Daud after that to have dinner, i ordered a mee goreng and teh tarik , he a really expensive plate of nasi lemak considering the pathetic chicken wing he got with it , it looked more like a chick than a chicken i tell ya ! After that we went to Bedok Interchange where we walked for a while and went back home , sigh i wish they do something to Bedok Central like add a ferris wheel or something its so damm boring!  (Slightly) Funny thing i was on my way to the bus stop but changed my mind and decided to walk home instead , it was like a good 20 minutes and when i got home i was sweating like a pig..I think when you are really bored you just try to do stuff to occupy your time. Anyway its good exercise right ?   Shynn from the job agency called me and told me i might get this temp job doing database admin at this american firm at a fucking pathetic 6 bucks an hr ...but i can't be choosy, need something IT-related that I can put on my resume. Gonna apply for this company called Crimson Logic tommorow , they got a vacancy for Java Developer which would be the perfect job for me cos i love programming in Java! Hope they grant me an interview... \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Went for an interview yesterday for this 1 1/2 month job and the interview didnt go too well, i know i probably not going to get the job. Anyway it kind of sucks cos just found out that a few friends of mine just got jobs already sigh ..happt for them but also feeling kinda sad that i'm still no where near to getting one myself. Wonder how long this is going to last ....  Played basketball with my friend in the afternoon today for like 20 minutes and after that we were sweating like pigs ! oops i mean perspiring ..now my muscles are aching like crazy . But it was good to get off my butt and do some real exercise after like so many months of inactivity and We are gonna play tommorow morning also ! But we were interuppted by a group of mats who took over the court to play soccer. I wanted to tell those assholes off , i mean its a basketball court not a soccer court ! anyway sam said we should just leave but it really pissed me off !  Getting kind of frustrated with my hi fi cos i think the lens is dirty or something it keeps skipping no matter what disc i play. Have to go down to Bedok and get the lens cleaner thingy asap before i go crazy !    \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Wow i checked out  urlLink Di's blog  and was kinda shocked to see her recommending my blog ! eh Di i was kidding when i said highlight my website leh , a link can already what ! : ) And she called me a music geek , i mean the Indian Stallion is no geek ok, im way cool, if i was any cooler people would be calling me Vanilla Ice, thats how cool i am.

Well she did most of the choosing , i mean for me all the picture frames look the same ! anyway after that we went to Mos burger to have dinner. I was talking to her about Sharon , well she brought it up cos i told her abt Sharon the first time we were going out, so she was wondering how things were between me and her . Anyway next thing i know i was telling her everything that happened , i guess it was just something i needed to just tell someone. And i'm glad i did cos she really made me feel better, and for the first time i feel like im ready to put all the stuff that happened behind me.   \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Some days i wonder why i was born an Indian ...today was one such day. My parents and my two aunts are sitting in the hall watch this tamil variety show. So i sit down and watch with them out of courtesy lah. I''m watching the show and i'm trying to figure out whats so interesting about it. In the show its basically local Indian stars dancing and lip-synching to songs from the tamil movies , or else they themselves would be singing the songs, like karaoke. And I'm thinking to myself why would anyone wanna see something like that ? Really dun understand ...sigh \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Ok sigh boring weekend so far , just spend most of my time playing Neverwinter Nights, damm dun u just hate it when they make a game so good you cant help wasting your life on it ...but learn quite a lot of things applicable in real life from this game for e.g. do not accept sexual favors from women in return for sparing their lives ! ok maybe not that applicable in real life but you never know... Was going to go to the library today to borrow a good fantasy book so i was online looking for some recommendations but all of them were on loan or not at Bedok Library ..damm Bedok Library really sucks i tell ya.... Hopefully i get to watch 2001 Space Odyssey later , if i dun get asked to do any housework by my parents ...supposed to be a classic or something ...just hope there's going to some scary aliens and bloody space battles in it ..nah just kidding Di ! ;)  Oh yeah also got Billy Elliot on StarMovies at 9 pm , sounds like an interesting story , a boy who rather do ballet than boxing but only thing abt brit movies is sometimes i got a really hard time understanding their accent though .  \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Went to Serangoon Broadway Photo Studio today, kinda pissed with them cos they told me that they would give those pictures that i didn't choose to develop, to their lab and ultimately it would be destroyed. So i asked them if they could give me the negatives and they said no. Talk abt doing anything to make a profit , well seriously have to thank my dad for this ...He was the one who was like rushing me to find a photo studio the night before so i just choose a random one and now seems like it turns out to be a wrong one. At least if i had more time i could ask my friends who already graduated for recommendations ..Oh well no point regretting now ...I just wish he stops doing that, dun know why he has this need to do everything in the fastest possible time even when its not necessary , its really irritating sometimes. Oh yeah on the way there on the bus i was listening to Tool's Aenima and got so caught up in it i began singing along (oops!) and the auntie beside me started looking me in fear like i was some psycho or something. Oh well not the first time a woman thot i was a psycho anyway.  \"He had a lot to say. He had a lot of nothing to say. We'll miss him. So long. We wish you well.

Met a really annoying catholic yesterday, you know the type who thinks they have to tell how great their religion is to anyone who isnt a Catholic. I tried to steer the conversation to something non-religious but it was really futile. I talked abt Lord Of the Rings and she's like \"Tolkien is a Catholic and he was really happy when his son became a priest\"  ..and im thinking should i say something like 'Praise the Lord' ...Then she was like preaching abt true happiness and like theres many kinds of happiness and by that time it was like 3 am so i just said gdnite and went to sleep ...   \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Another pretty uneventful day , played online scrabble with a net friend for a couple of hours and got trashed like nobody business...damm you know that \"ef\" is actually a word ???

Abt the movie well it steals from the Ring and What Lies Beneath and there are like 2 scenes that scared me thats about it. And also the director keeps showing flashbacks to the past in the movie , but there is no indication they are flashbacks and i got confused sometimes whether i was watching a scene from the present or the past. Highly NOT recommended!   \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      I don't know why im even posting this : (    urlLink     What Kind of Virgin Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Just took this quiz for the fun for it(Yes i know i'm not a woman).

But even if I wrote it in Tamil I still have to translate it to English so that my fans can understand so it will be pointless.

Faith told me that her colleague isn't too impressed with my grades; said he expected better. So basically that's the end of that. Honestly i have to say I'm really disappointed that I didn't get an interview; i know that I'm a really good Java Programmer; all I need now is some employer to give me a chance to show it. Just gotta keep looking until I find that person.   I am jet black.  I am stone cold.  Jet black to the center.  Funny like a funeral.  I need you to bury me.

The guy goes to a different gal every night and makes out with them and at the end of the date he asks them whether they wanna spend the night together. And yet i still can't not watch it. I think Shannon is gonna get voted out cos she's the only one who is upset about the fact how sleazy it the whole scenarion was and not letting him get his way with her. Well no one forced her to join the show right.....  Ah-ha I was right, Shannon was the one asked to leave; So that leaves the other 2 gals, the one who admitted her boobs were fake and the other one whose boobs are probably fake. And Shannon can still ask the guy why she was voted off. Of course he said because it was they were 2 very different people yada yada. Hello it's because he didnt get past first base with her unlike the other 2. But wonder she even joined the show; must be a little thick in a head if you ask me.\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      I hate to be in a conflict with someone. Most of the time when something like that happens I try to resolve it as soon as possible and just move on. I guess its because i believe that life is short and you never know what might happen tommorow also; for all I know I might get hit by a car or something and die. And as weird and morbid as it sounds, I wanna die without any unresolved conflicts in my life. But of cos its easier said than done; sometimes you just can't forgive someone for something they did to us no matter how hard we try , and even more so if they aren't remorseful about it and think they didn't do anything wrong.    What's the meanest you can be to the one you claim to love  And still smile to your new found friends?  In the same confusing breath,  You pull away and draw me in.  I wanted you. You wanted more.

Her mom was caught in a serious motorbike accident and now she might not be able to walk. Kinda makes you realise how unpredictable life is; all it takes is one unforseen tragedy to turn your whole world upside down. And it also made me put my problems in perspective. I'm forever whining abt my lack of job opportunities and how boring my life is but maybe i should be grateful for the good things in my life, that i am healthy and that my family is healthy also.

Still feeling the effects of the pizza yesterday and my stomach/ass has been hurting like hell since I got up. But still went to Hafeez's house to scan my transcripts and stuff to send to Faith's colleague  but when i got back one of the floppies i saved into couldnt work. Isn't it amazing how technology has ignored the floppy. CD-ROM, CPUs and almost everything else is faster and better but not the floppy. i mean I'm sure there is a way to increase the durability/speed/size of the floppy right its been the same since i first started using the PC which was like in December 98.  Anyway i left a message on Hafeez's mobile to email me the pics on the spoiled copy, hope he sends it to me as soon as possible. Got a shock of my life when Audrey called me on my handphone yesterday, I thought something bad happened cos we never talked on the phone before. Well thankfully i was wrong ...lol i think shes like the chirppiest person i ever met, she's like so hyper and sounds so cheerful ! She was telling me how excited she was about me coming to join her at work and how great it's gonna be with me there! Sigh talk abt pressure; i dun know .....hope I don't disappoint her too much.

Well just have to see how it goes.....but dun wanna get my hopes up too much cos did that way too much the past few months and i just got really disappointed when those opportunities did't materialise.

I even had to fill in the application form by hand cos it was stated explicitedly..ya like my handwriting is a clue to what kind of employee i would be .. Dumbasses !  Oh ya and i had to provide details abt my parents's occupations and my sister's also, again why the fuck does that matter !   I guessed my dad changed his mind about putting up the xmas decorations today cos he didnt wake me up.. Thank god ! Now all i got to do is pray for the hotel job to start soon so i dun need to help him ..ya ya you might think its really selfish of me but you haven't worked with my dad b4 . do that and you will know what i mean.    Other than that spend a good part of the day talking to Faith and doing the daily boring household chores ....i wonder if they have those mousewheels for people, u know the one where the hamster or mouse runs in;; then i could get into one of them and just run all day long; at least that would occupy my time and keep me from dying of boredom.   I wish TCS would just cancel all its local productions cos come on they really suck. Living with Lydia stars ...err ...this rather large Hongkong actress with a horrible haircut who has the most annoying way of speaking English in my opinion; she stresses every words i mean whats up with that. Phua Chu Kang used to be funny but now its just really tired and they seem to be rehashing the same old jokes again...And lets not forget First Touch the local medical drama that takes place in a maternity hospital which strangely looks nothing like a maternity hospital maybe cos its just a cheap tacky set .

Oh ya yesterday at Suntec i saw the strangest sight; people standing having their dinner on tables that had no chairs having their dinner ! Well a friend told me it was pretty common nowdays but I dun know just seemed strange and a little cruel...but thats me.  I should be starting very soon at the hotel; my sis called me and told me to get prepared. Hope I dun screw it up !   Hmm Lana Lang doesn't look like her usual hot self in today's Smallville episode.....something's different maybe it's her make up or something. Gonna have to write to her about that ....btw I don't care if you are Superman, no one misses a Radiohead concert to save his best friend's life !!!   My dad just told me thatwe have to wake up early at 8 am tommorow to do the Christmas decorations for our house....guess he forgot that Christmas is still more than A MONTH AWAY.

Oh ya and she gave me the 'Dangerous Liasons' VCD in exchange for my three Janet Jackson CDs. Thats like the movie i been looking for since i was 5, but its censored so I won't get to see Uma Thurman's boobs ..sigh...After that we went to meet Xing and his friend Marcus, the one i thought wanted to hire me. But turned out to be a complete waste of time cos he wasn't the least bit interested in talking to me, spend more time talking to his gf ! I already knew that he wasn't interested when he talked to me over the phone few days earlier; basically after he found out that I didn't know VB/ASP he cut the conversation short. And I told Xing about it but he told me it's ok and to come for the meeting anyway. Now it just seemed like a waste of my time.  CDs I listened to today: 1. Dummy by Portishead 2.

Speaking of net friends wondering what happened to Di, haven't seen her for like almost a week. It feels kinda strange when you see someone almost everyday and suddenly they don't come online for a while ...anyway she's probably busy with her packing and getting her student visa and stuff.

Oh ya watched Star Wars and Scream 3 on Ch 5 yesterday; Star Wars was as great as i remembered it I can't believe the number of people who haven't seen this classic! Scream 3 was really awful and just so damm boring, which is really shocking considering how good the first one was.\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Woohoo just finished debugging this JSP Project i'm doing for Shi Yang; it's like this online engineering quiz. Anyway been working on it for a while now but after the operation i had a few months ago i kinda lost interest in it, also dun know why. Anyway last couple of days I have been working really long and hard to make it work and now it's almost done, just a few things left to sort out depending on what Shi Yang wants. But feel quite shiok when i finally got it to work, it's almost like an orgasm i tell you. I think I'm gonna call myself the JSP King from now on ...Screw you NCS for not hiring me; next time when im rich and famous i'm gonna make it my personal mission to bring you down !!  *laughs like Dr. Evil*  Note to myself : You seriously need help, geek !    urlLink Online Engineering Quiz \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Went to the market around 9 am with my mom today, cos i had to deposit money into Theresa's bank account which was right beside the market so i figured i might as well go with her. Made an interesting observation : All the women at the market were at least in their late 30s, did'nt see anyone younger than that ! Hmm wonder why....  OK been playing around with Photoshop  7 today, and its really fun ! Tried this cool effect on my Manson banner above , if you wanna see it all you got to do is move your mouse over it.: ) Pretty cool rite ! Have to thank my mentor Faith for inspiring me to learn this : ) Thanks love ! OK well maybe its not much but hey I just started give me a couple of weeks at least alright !   Kinda worried about going to work at the hotel cos i'm afraid it might jeopardise the relationship I have with Auds. I mean we get along fairly well now, afraid things might change if we started working together, like it will get all awkward and weird or something. She seems pretty excited abt working with me and i'm kinda afraid that well i might not live up to her expectations of what she thinks i am like in real life...Oh well just gotta wait and see i guess...But Theresa was saying that she's really popular at the hotel, and shes picking up things so fast that they dun believe she's never worked in a job like this before. Sheesh talk about pressure ! \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Theresa called me and told me I would probably be able to start working with her at the end of the month. Finally i'm getting off my fat ass and earning some money. I-admin hasn't called me yet so I dun think I got the job, if i did they would have pretty much called me earlier i think. Hopefully i will get to see Harry Potter next week , two friends already said it was a pretty good movie.  Tried to watch the 2nd half of 2001 Space Odyssey but got way too sleepy , i dun think i will ever get the movie !  Arrgh totally forgot to watch Temptation Island, was so engrossed with Silence of the Lambs on Channel I that i forgot.\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Missed blogging yesterday ..actually not missed just nothing of note to write about ..went to Parkway Parade with Hafeez to buy his kettle jug thingy, walked ard a bit and came back home ....  Today not much better, just waiting to watch survivor which starts in a while. Gonna head down to library to borrow some ASP books , think im gonna need to learn it cos lots of jobs are asking for it. And maybe XML also ....So bored...hope i-admin calls me soon!   Been listening to a couple of my old CDs (Vitalogy and No Code by Pearl Jam, Color and the Shape by Foo Fighters) last few days, I really need to get one of big CD Racks to hold my CDs, now they are all over my room.   Dun know what is gonna happen between me and a net friend, think she's still pissed at me. I told her she was overreacting and that made her even more pissed. Sometimes it doesn't pay to be honest i tell ya. I mean i already apologized like a million times and she still doesn't wanna talk to me, what else does she want? Maybe its dumb of me to react the way i did , i mean I shouldn't have cared that she still considers a guy that 2-timed her to be sweet and caring and wanted to call him. Or that this same 'sweet and caring' guy was trying to get back together with her just a month back eventhough he IS still with his girlfriend. I guess I just have to learn not to say anything even if i think they are gonna get hurt. It's not like i know her personally!\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      My cousin is going for a vacation in December and he asked my dad whether he could leave his dog here for 3 weeks. My dad said yes as usual. It didn't matter that my cousin has talked to us for like a year before today. Or that I'm probably the one who is gonna have to handle the dogs while he is off to work. Or that the 3 of them will make a hell lot of noise and give the neighbour upstairs another chance to call the cops on us. Some people just dun know how to say NO i guess. I am in a really irritable mood today, its like male PMS or something !  \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      OK so this was how the interview went. Basically he asked me a lot of technical questions that i really couldn't answer cos i couldn't remember! It's been a while. Should have revised beforehand damm ...but overall i did OK.  Anyway the job wasn't what i thought it was, as it wasn't a programming job like i expected. Instead i would be like the link between the client and the programmers; I would ask the clients to describe what they want in the system and then design the system and hand it over to the programmers to code.  Pros of the job :  1. I will be able to travel overseas quite often to meet clients. (a huge plus) 2. It's gonna force me to improve my people skills which admittedly are pretty crappy now. 3. The company really seems to be doing very well, so my future prospects look to be really good  Cons: 1. I wouldn't be learning any new programming skills. 2. I really wanna do programming cos i think i got a flair for it. 3. I have to deal with strangers a lot.   Sigh ....  Oh ya bloody Wei Qin played me out! We were supposed to go see 'The Guru' but he dumped me for a barbecue at his friend's place ...sniff ...\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Just got called for the 2nd interview , it's tommorow at 11 am !\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Ok I'm back from my interview.  Next time i'm going for an interview im gonna bring a compass or something, its ridiculous how road maps can differ so much from the real thing ! Was wandering around for a good 20 minutes until i finally found the place. Ok now Abt the interview! Well when i got there i was really pumped cos I was listening to Slipknot on the way there; hey if that CD doesn't get your adrenalin pumping nothing will ! But the interview was really surprising, i wouldn't even call it an interview , more like an evaluation. The 7 of us (1 person didn't turn up) who got called were split into 2 teams and given this question to discuss : If you were stranded in the desert and given a list of items , how would you rank them in order of importance. The items included stuff like a litre of water , matches , mirror etc etc. Well i was pretty vocal the whole time and I also presented my team's findings. And that was the end of the interview! Overall i think i did a pretty good job. Gonna be really disappointed if I'm not called up for a 2nd interview.  Oh ya i was like totally overdressed ; i was the only one wearing a tie out of the 5 guys there . So paiseh ....Anyway the company is a pretty small office and the mood is very casual, i think it would be a pretty cool place to work. But well now jsut wait for his phone call lor... Kinda pissed at my sis, she keeps forgetting to call Audrey abt the Shangri-la job and i have to like keep reminding her ! I mean if you forgot once its ok lah , but 3 times a little excessive if you ask me.  Now waiting for Lana Lang/Smallville ...hmm is it at 10 or 11 ? Can't remember .....  \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Bored people do strange things. I just spend like an hour cataloguing all the CDs i have and transferred them into a urlLink  webpage . So far i got 108 CDs not including my CDs pre-college (Ace of Base, Mariah Carey) , i thought i had much more.   Also watched the M. Night movie, Unbreakable, on StarMovies couple hours ago and i thought it was pretty engrossing take on the superhero genre but the ending was really abrupt, i think the movie should have played out the conclusion onscreen rather than using the on screen text at the end to wrap up the movie.    Think i might have overreacted a little on the not saying goodbye thingy (see earlier post) but it was the 2nd time it happened to me yesterday and got me really irritated. Seemed to be getting more and more irritable these days ..hmm \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      OK finally finished writing the email describing my 'soft' skills ; the guy from i-admin asked me to send it to him. So what did I write ? Well a lot of crap that isn't really true, how i'm like ultra friendly, able to multi-task and work well with others, how i like to take initiative in everything I do. Of cos i already thought of fake examples to show them in case he asks me to give examples, which i'm sure he will.   Going to watch Mulholland Drive later, that David Lynch movie, a friend was describing to me how amazing and bizarre it was and i'm really curious about it right now.   I wished people would have the courtesy to at least say bye before they log off during an online conversation, I think it's kinda rude when you are in the middle of an interesting conversation with someone and then they just abruptly disappear. I thought maybe she got dc so i waited for like 5 minutes and then i thought maybe i pissed her off or something. I mean how long does it take to type \"Gotta go. goodnight\" ?   Now gotta go and prepare for my interview, must think of what I'm gonna say when he asks me to describe myself and all that !   Oh ya was really surprised to hear \"Forsaken\" from the Queen of the Dammed soundtrack on TV yesterday! It was the background music for the \"Who wants to be a Millionaire trailer, pretty weird choice for a gameshow trailer. Anyway It's the best song off the album and I highly recommend the album to anyone who likes dark, gothic sounding haunting music; 5 songs (including Forsaken) are written by Jonathan Davis from Korn specifically for the movie and Linkin Park (I hate them) fans should check out \"System\" which features Chester on vocals which I have to admit isn't half bad.  \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Got a call from this company called i-admin asking me to come down for an interview on monday, Bad news is the pay is a pathetic 1500 a month ! But i got no choice gotta go for it, beggars can't be choosers rite. So if i get it i will be earning 1k less than my friends in NCS...Life so fucking sucks doesn't it !   Other than that a really boring day, watched another ep of six feet under today and the first ep of sex and the city. ( i thought it was sex in the city ). And got this really bad headache that has been going on for 2 whole days, hope it disappears soon enuff; feels like someone drilling a screw into my brain.\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      I'm a fucking idiot.\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Woohoo yeah this is my new blog design , thanks to Faith. I saw the one she did for her sister and was pretty impressed so i asked her to help me out and this is the end result ! Sigh if only she wasn't married i would propose to her !   Ok so went for my first jog in months at East Coast with Ben but only jogged like a kilometre before it started to rain. *Bert secretly thanks god* . After that we went to Komala Villas for lunch where i had thosai rava, it was ok but nowhere near as good as the ones at Little India. After that we walked all the way back to his place in which he proceeded to show off his extensive collection of porn in his PC ;) Went back at around 7pm cos he was going to meet his girlfriend.   Arrgh I forgot to watch Charmed today , only managed to catch the last 15 minutes ....but thank god there's still Smallville! My darling Lana Lang ....*swoons*\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Ok missed blogging yesterday because i was at my sister's place the whole day for Deepavali. Woke up at 5:30 am yesterday cos my mom had to be at my sis's place early to cook her world-famous 'ayam masak merah' which also happens to be my favourite dish. As usual my dad was trying to rush us all along like we were in a damm race or something.  Anyway while i was there something really embarassing happened. The hall was pretty crowded with a lot of her guests so i sat on this old wooden chair. All of a sudden it just broke and i ended up flat on my ass! At least most of the guests tried their best not to laugh though which was really nice of them ....   Dad pissed me off again. Ben called me at 9 am today and i was still asleep. My dad answered the phone and instead of telling him to call back later, he felt the need to wake me up! What's his freaking problem ?   Been thinking of trying to patch up with Sharon. I think we had a really meaningful (net) friendship b4 all that stuff happened and i would hate to see that just disappear without at least trying to save it. But even she doesn't want to, i hope we can at least part amicably cos i think its pointless to hold grudges considering how short life is. And there are also a few things that i really need to tell her also that i didnt before because i didnt wanna complicate matters, but now i just wanna be honest with her. The only thing i'm afraid of is that she would think that i'm doing this cos i wanna go out with her or something which is the last thing on my mind. Anyway she's probably having her exams now so i'm gonna wait until the end of the month cos i really don't wanna risk upsetting her now during this crucial exam period.  Oh yeah saw the funniest website today check the  urlLink Asian Prince  out ! \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      You know what I really need to stop taking net relationships so seriously. Why the hell should i care if a gal describes a guy who conveniently forgot to to mention to her that he had a gf while he was dating her,and basically treated her like crap , \"sweet, caring and really comfortable with himself\" ? It's not as if i know her personally or something !     Just got a phone call from my dad : \"Gilbert come up to the 11th floor , LISTEN CAREFULLY , the 11th floor and help me carry some stuff\"   Isn't it nice when your dad thinks you are such a fucking moron that he needs to repeat what he's saying and even remind you to listen carefully?   And let's not forget his need to tell me EVERYTIME i take the dogs for a walk where i should walk them !  Can anyone say CONTROL FREAK!   I left a used tissue on the couch by mistake, i was watching tv and i forgot to throw it away b4 i went into my room. My mom then told me about it and i threw it away. But apparently that wasn't enough , she had to complain to my sister about that tissue. And my sister still felt the need to talk to me abt it ! Forget about Six Feet Under, if you wanna see a dysfunctional family just come to my house.  Yeh Li just showed me this website done by this 17 year old guy , and its so good that its fucking depressing! If you wanna see it Click  urlLink Here . But he digs the same bands as me (Mushroomhead, Korn) so more power to him i say !   I added a little more information about myself and also a link to another blog , Audrey's friend Cheng whom i don't really know personally but her blog is pretty well done (although sometimes I got problem understanding it sometimes but i think thats my problem)  and she has commented on my blog a couple of times which is really nice of her. \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Ok just came back from Somerset, went to see Red Dragon with Yeh Li and Jiaqi, it was pretty good movie, very entertaining, way better than the crap that was Hannibal but not as engrossing as Silence of the Lambs. Would have loved to see more of Anthony Hopkins though i think he was rather underused.Oh ya Jiaqi and Yeh Li forgot to pay me for the movie tickets and i also paiseh to ask them for it....Cos i didnt wanna seem too money minded mah ...  Oh ya why are women late for dates/outings so often, its so irritating, Jiaqi and Yeh Li were more than half and hour late ! They should have at least given me an expected time of arrival so at least i would have an idea what time they will reach.   After that we went to Youth Park to see a couple of local bands perform in this band competition. A couple of bands were pretty good, and i really enjoyed their performances but the rest of them were average. And i did come away with a poster of the Foo Fighters they were giving those away. Left around 7pm cos Yeh Li and Jiaqi wanted to go back and i didn' wanna really stay there by myself kinda sian also.   \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Ok i changed the comment server to Haloscan so all four of you can start commenting again, yeah i know you guys been dying to do it for the past few days. I asked a friend to give me her comment account at YACCS but she refused. Sigh there used to be a time when girls would do anything for the Indian Stallion ....   I'm blasting Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar right now cos I'm alone at home woohoo! Listening to the song Beautiful People right now. \"The beautiful people, the beautiful people, it's all relative to the size of your steeple\"  That lyric always cheers me up ...hey wait a minute, by right it shouldn't!  : (  Something i can never figure out is how my dogs sleeping in my room aren't disturbed by the music. Dogs are supposed to have a much keener sense of hearing compared to humans right ? So how come the loud music from the Hi-fi doesnt affect them at all? i mean hell my parents complain abt my music everytime! Maybe it shows that dogs can appreciate good music !   I'm heading down to town later to catch the movie Red Dragon with Jiaqi and Yeh Li cos bloody Ivan cancelled at the last minute. HE says he hasn't slept in the last 5 days and some other crap like that. Like I care ! \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Dun you just hate it when a joke backfires in your face?     I send out this joke sms last night that said that i was in the hospital , but if you scroll down the message you will realise its just a prank. But most of the people i send to didnt scroll so they really thought i was in hospital and sms me back which i thought was pretty funny. (Hey i'm bored and unemployed ok, everything seems funny to me ). Then an hour ago while i was sleeping in bed (and i think i was dreaming abt me and Uma Thurman doing something fun) , and my friend who just came back from Paris called me up because she thought the sms was real. Well now i can't go back to sleep : ( . Yeah she's an air stewardess with SIA so she flies to all these exotic locations every week. Sigh makes me wish i was an air stewardess also...  I hate it when i see people unhappy, for some reason it really bothers me. And its even worse when i can't do anything to cheer the person up and most of the time i can't, guess i just dun have the knack for it.   The damm enetation server has been down for like 3 days now, and i think im gonna look for another one to host my comments. But can't blame the enetation creater also , he is only 1 guy running the whole thing and the problem is there are too many members then his server is able to handle. I checked out the forum and there are a lot of complaints about the server crashing so often and it sounds like he is gonna quit pretty soon.\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Hmm i think i should take a notebook with me when i go out, there was so many things that i thought of when i was out and was gonna write them down here, but now i can only remember 1.   Well here goes : At the train station there were this students who were taking donations for a particular charity, and a lot of people just rushed past ignoring them. And I seen this happen like my whole life, but only today it really bothered me. Are people now so busy that they can't even stop for a couple of secs and donate some coins to charity ? And yes i know it sounds a little self-righteous but thats what i feel   Met wee at Sim Lim Square where i bought 50 CD-Rs for 30 bucks to burn all my eps of Six Feet Under its really taking a chunk out of my HD space. And then i as i walked around i saw another shop selling 50 CDRs for 20 bucks dammit. After that went to BK where i had a whopper meal and was given an  EXTRA  packet of fries by mistake. Yes finally i catch a lucky break in my life ! The world seems so much brighter now !   \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      A gal from the company i went for interview for called me today to tell me that she regretted to inform me that i didnt make the cut. Yeah thanks woman for picking New Year's Eve to tell me this , now im feeling really moody about it ...anyway doesnt matter cos its not like im going to go out and celebrate new year also, probably gonna countdown at home with my 2 dogs , probably try to get them to bark once the clock hits midnight or something.  \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Met Faith today to exchange Xmas presents; she bought for me Time to Kill by John Grisham and i got for her a gift pack from Body Shop (thanks to Di for the idea) . Heh now i got so many books to read , still got 3 harry potter novels left and so far i only read like the first 2 chapters of the Philosopher's Stone. Oh ya i was waiting for Faith at City Hall MRT and saw this pretty volouptous ang moh gal wearing a teensy singlet and no bra and basically her boobs were on full display...sigh those ang mohs are a really daringbunch aren't they ? If only more local gals dressed like that ; the world would be a much happier place! Ya ya i'm a perv i know so sue me !   We went for lunch at Ganges, an indian vegetarian restaurant upon my request cos i decided I'm gonna try to eat healthy at least when i'm outside. But when i got back home i had like 3 slices of rich chocolate log cake that was in the fridge..ok ok 4 slices happy ! What to do , chocolate is my kyptonite when i see it i can't help but feel this urge to have it ! :( I think i would do ANYTHING, and i mean ANYTHING to get chocolate so any gals reading this you might wanna take note in case you wanna take advantage of the Stallion ...yeah dun tell me the thought has never crossed your mind ok ! ;)   Went to watch Blue Crush after that ; some of the lines in the movie were plain corny and really made me cringe but overall the movie was ok , mindless and generic plot but still pretty fun; cos the surf scenes were amazing and the lead actress was quite a hottie also.   \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Oh man my parents went to the market , had thosai for breakfast at the hawker centre there but didnt even think abt buying some back for me !! Unbelievable ! \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Alright yesterday my mom's ayam masak merah also went bad! I think its because someone used the same ladle on that dish and the catered food on Xmas day so the bacteria got transferred. It kinda sucked cos there was like a lot of it left but no choice had to throw it away. I told my dad to give his bloody friend (the one we catered the food from) a piece of his mind but he's like \"let it be\" ....pfff he should be the Fifth Beatle or something!   Other than that it was a great day cos i met up with my long lost cousin Shirley who i havent seen like in 8 over years ; she came with her folks to my house yesterday. We used to be really close when we were kids cos back then my family stayed at her home for a couple of years, so it was really nice to catch ya with her and see how's shes doing and stuff. Even got her on my msn messenger so hopefully we can keep in touch ....   We all then went to my aunt's place later at night and i met up with Cecelia and Damian my other cousins as well ..So all in all it was a pretty good day, compared to my usual day where i just rot at home! Hopefully this happens more often! \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      OK well so what happened on Xmas day ...well for starters a lot of people told my sister that i put on a hell lot of weight which was reallly depressing but it was true. OK so my New Year resolution is to get rid of my baby or at least reduce it by a sizable amount. For those who are clueless my baby is my tummy :) . Im gonna head down to the bball court everyday and like shoot hoops or something for a start ! Anyway I have to also cos my reservist training is in April and i dun wanna go into it unfit cos it would be that much harder then. Oh and i gotta see my cousins Slyvester (although i call him Silver since we were kids) and Damien so that was pretty cool although they didn't stay that long. My mom was pretty unhappy with the way Silver looked cos he was like having an eyebrow ring and stuff, and she was like 'im glad you didnt turn out like that\" ...She can be so shallow sometimes.  Hmm just wondering is it considered perverted to think that your 17 year old distant cousin is a total babe cos she is ! She has one of those eyes that those Hindi actresses have , the kind of eyes that sparkle ...all the chicks i dig are either attached or too young or related to me or think I'm creepy ....sigh ....  Oh ya the catered food that my dad ordered from his working colleague went bad by evening; think cos they probably cooked it like the day b4  in the morning. Well hope he learns his lesson and not be so easily influenced by people next time; but i doubt it cos this kinda thing happened like countless times b4 , he can be so naive .\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Ok today aka Xmas day was tiring and depressing ...WIll blog abt it tommorow cos im dead beat ! \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      At my sister's house today; met her at Causeway Point to buy out clothes for Xmas. It kinda sucked cos there were a few clothes that i really liked but they didn't have my size. It's like prejudice against big-boned people or something. But the thing abt those full length mirrors in the changing rooms is they made me realised how much weight i put on! Really need to do something abt it ASAP or pretty soon i have to call myself the Indian Hippo or something. Anyway managed to find 2 decent tees in my size which i bought.  By that time it was around 10 pm so i decided to stay over at her place ; and so now here I am. But i can feel a cold coming over me , feeling kinda hot and also my running nose is getting worse; hope that clears up by Xmas day. Hmm kinda strange last 2 days not a lot of people online at night ...so boring no one to talk to and I'm not sleepy yet. Oh well i guess I'm gonna play TNET then.\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Met a net friend today at Siglap , she was nice enuff to meet me to pass me her harry potter books ! Thanks love ! I lended her 2 CDs of mine , Foo Fighters's  urlLink There is Nothing Left to Lose  and my treasured Led Zeppelin's BBC Sessions. Sigh i'm gonna miss that CD been listening to it everyday the past week. Hope she likes them ! \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n       urlLink  Hmm just realised this year has been kinda disappointing in terms of music i listened to. I haven't heard any album this year that completely blew me away and that is something very unusual for me . For last year that album was  urlLink Relationship of Command  by At the Drive-In; For 2000 it was  urlLink Slipknot' s self titled.  Listened to a couple of great albums this year , the best of which was Korn's  urlLink Untouchables  and Queens of the Stone Age's  urlLink Songs for the Deaf  but they still have their flaws. But I haven't bought a lot of albums this year compared to last year mainly cos of the lack of funds .  Can't wait till i get a job, i think i will probably be buying like 2 - 3 CDs a month at least once I do .Until then MP3s have to do. But the biggest disappointment this year has to be Creed's  urlLink Weathered  , when i heard it i couldn't imagine how a band i used to love can put out crap like that . I think i gave it like 10 listens before i gave up; probably the worst album i heard in a while. Btw i'm willing to let it go for 10 bucks so if anyone is interested contact me ok.(it comes with a free VCD of some of their music videos)   Just saw the last hour of Survivor , i totally forgot that this was the season finale so i missed the first hour when Helen got voted off. But the grilling by the jury on Clay and the other guy was really brutal. Well of cos it's all ego. I mean almost everyone did lie to someone one time or another ,but when they get lied to and it resulted in them getting voted off they get all defensive and self-righteous and using words like honestly, decency and self-respect ...Hypocrites everyone of them! Hope Clay loses i really dun like that lazy ass.    \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Ok i dun like to use this word but dammit Flo is a bitch  ! I have no idea how Zach puts up with her cos when i watch her on TV i already get so pissed ! She's like a little kid throwing stupid dumbass tantrums all the time and blaming Zach for any screw up that happens. Just now she wanted to give up on the race because she didnt think she could take a 24 hr ride on the train ! I mean jesus you are in a race for a million dollars , suck it up and stop whining! Well thats what I would have told her if I was Zach , but he was like so patient and accomodating; i really have to tip my hat off to him.He should get like an award or something just for putting up with her. I am such an idiot ..i didn't know that today was the finale so after the first hour of the amazing race i switched off the tv ....then i switch it on at 5 just in time to see the winners being congratualted !! now gotta watch it in the evening again but i already know who is gonna win ...idiot ! \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Arrgh bloody stupid TCS ..i was so looking forward to watch the babe-fests Charmed and Smallville on Ch 5 yesterday night but they got pre-empted and instead I was treated to a soccer match where Malaysia trashed us 4-0 ....\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Ok just came back from my interview at this company thats working for Mindef. Didn't go too well the test that they gave me was pretty hard It was about networking and machine language code and stuff that i havent touched like forever. But at least i did better than the guy next to me ; he even had trouble just filling in his personal particulars form :)  And also the other candidates were like so unfriendly ; i was chatting with one of them but he had to go soon after but the others were like so reluctant to talk to me...but well the indian stallion does intimidate most men so can't really blame them also. After i finished the test , or at least finished as much as i could i had to wait like over an hour before they called me for interview which was kinda unprofessional in my opinion; i mean i was on time so why can't they also !   Got interviewed by 3 pple including one chio bu who i was like kinda making eyes at throughout the interview ...i could swear she was looking at me lustily also ....or hmm maybe she looked annoyed i couldn't really tell also. Probably shouldn't have done that but hey i'm a guy ! Anyway they looked at my test results and didnt seem too impressed so i think that was that. After that the chio bu lead me out of the office and said she will call me in a week or so. Damm should have asked for her phone number or something ! : ( Anyway i think i need to get new pants; its so weird its like all my pants shrank at the same time incredibly bizarre i tell ya ! \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Arrgh dad pissed me off again!! My aunt still hasn't come down to collect my old PC that my dad so generously gave to her for free eventhough she already has 1 ; so now my dad wants me to bring the PC to her in Yishun !! Like i got nothing better to do ! I mean you give people stuff for free thats one thing ; but if they can't be bothered to come down and get it why the fuck should you bring it to them ...and i got fucked when i told him that ...  Well he brought it there himself...and also brought along our bike and carrom board to my aunt .....wonder whats next   Went to the provision shop just now and the shopkeeper tells me that his daughter is working at Hongkong Bank might have vacancies at the bank and he will ask her if can get me in ...isn't that like the nicest thing !?   Uggh yesterday's Fear Factor was the worst yet ..i mean eww pig's uterus; can't get worse than that !\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Went to OCBC today to deposit some money for my sis ...the damm queue was like so long i think i was in it for like almost 40 minutes ..sigh the things you do for your sis ... Was kinda pissed at my dad today; he sometimes seems so naive ...he ordered catered food for christmas from a 'friend' it costed him ard 300 bucks ..but the stupid thing is that they dun deliver the food which is so freaking ridiculous and the guy lives in woodlands which is like so damm far....and catered indian food usually sucks 9/10 times , speaking from experience , and also i was so looking forward to my mom's ayam masak merah ..i hope the food isn't gonna suck but im not holding my breath. Now Dad says he's gonna try get back the money and cancel the order ..well good luck with that.\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Got called up for an interview for a company at Science Park which is just beside NUS .....but there is gonna be an hour long test to see how my programming skills are ..hope I dun screw this up like i did for the other one..... Spend the whole day listening repeatedly to Led Zeppelin's  urlLink BBC Sessions  , a 2 CD set of their performances for BBC in the late 60s; its simply amazing . Anyone who loves the sound of the electric guitar should get this ....the amazing solos by Jimmy Page are like orgasm-inducing; in my opinion he's the best guitarist ever , yes i think even better than Hendrix. Add to that Bonham's booming drumming and Plant's amazing voice and ...well you just gotta listen to it for yourself.  At least check out the song \"Since I've been Loving You\" ...its amazing that a band that was playing before i was even born can still so fresh and relevant today , not in the slightest bit outdated.   One more thing . i wished people would stop saying stuff to me like \"Don't give up looking for a job\" or \" Are you jobless because the market is bad or you aren't trying hard enuff\" or \"you better get a job before the next batch graduates\". I swear im gonna fuck the next person who says that to me. They might mean well but it really gets on my nerves so pls don't. I am not going to give up cos that is not a viable option so people  do NOT need to remind me. And the other 2 are so dumb I won't even justify them.

Well i know nothing about it so probably gonna spend tommorow to go read up on it ...i think it has something to do with grids and computers though ;) . Other than that i would describe today as a complete waste of life.\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Ok Yesterday started off really crappy. I got asked to go for an interview , a temp job at this company at tanglin shopping center ...the pay was pretty good 7.50 an hour and renewed monthly. Anyway they were impressed by my resume but they gave me a test ...which was to modify a html page into a form page and using javascript to validate it ...its actually very simple i did it b4 for my school project but i screwed up , there was this damm javacript error and i couldnt fint the source of it ...so that went my chances of getting the job.   After that went to Borders and listened to some new CDs at the music section which made me feel a whole lot better. I have to get the White Stripes new CD,  urlLink White Blood Cells  . Some of you might remember the brother and sister band from their performance at the MTV Video Awards earlier this year , they were surrounded by fans dressed in red and white during their gig. Check out the song \"Fell in Love With a Girl\" if you wanna try its amazing!  Listened to Audioslave's new one also too , the band formed by the ex-members of  urlLink Rage Against the Machine (imo the only rap metal band with any cred that puts crap bands like Limp Biskit and Linkin Park to shame) and the frontman of  urlLink Soundgarden  who replaces Zack de la Rocha. Well have to say was kinda disappointed , Chris Cornell's vocals lack the intensity and the rage of Zack's vocals and also his lyrics arent really that great also compared to Zack's political rants.   An interesting logic puzzle :  Alright, there are 3 pple who got caught on a pirate ship. They were supposed to be killed but the captain gave them a chance. He has 4 caps, 2 white and 2 blacks. He made all 3 lined up and threw one cap in the sea. With the remaining caps, he put one on each person's head. The first person can only see the cap in the sea. The second person can only see the first person's cap. The 3rd person can see both pple's caps. The captain then said \"If you can guess the colour of your own cap correctly, all will be set free.\" There was a silence then the 2nd person answered correctly. Why is it the second person and how did he answer it correctly?  \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Finally me and Dad got to putting up the xmas decorations and it was worse than i expected. I was seriously pissed off by the time we stopped work at around 5. Dun feel like going into the details ...anyway i always get pissed when working with my dad so nothing new . And still not done got another day to go ..Well 1 thing was my dad played this horrible music on the stereo while we were working ...first CD was like the music you hear during Chinese New Year at those shopping centres; you know those happy bouncy crappy tunes with the traditional chinese instruments....CD2 was songs like Quit Playing Games by Backstreet Boys and other crappy love ballads; but the catch is they were sung by Filipino singers not the original artists which made it sound even worse ! I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at one point.Dun understand why anyone would wanna listen to that do you ?\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Had a really strange dream last night and the amazing thing is that it was so vivid i can remember almost ever part of it; and thats very rare for me cos i rarely remember my dreams. Even weirder was it was about a net friend i never even met before. It started off very nicely but then suddenly turned into a nightmare; the net friend in question jumped to her death and i was totally freaking out. Wonder what it means ....\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      So finally brought  urlLink Boy  to the vet today and got the medicine for his skin problem. Think he's gonna be ok in a week or so.But he yelped really loudly when he got his injection, scared me for a second. Oh and something really funny happened just now , my dad brought a couple of his friends back home and Boy got so excited that he got a hard-on which was really obvious although his friends were like trying their best to pretend not to notice. And then Boy's semen was like dripping all over the floor and my dad was like trying to clean it up, it was pretty funny stuff : )   Hmm not sure why theres this syntax error on my blog site ...been trying to fix it but so far cant pinpoint the problem. Any HTML experts there who can help me out ?   In my CD Player today : 1.  urlLink Untouchables  by Korn 2.  urlLink Follow the Leader  by Korn 3.  urlLink End Hits  by Fugazi\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Sigh i'm less and less inclined to blog nowdays ...just nothing interesting in my life right now worth typing about. Today i spend like 4 hours playing this  urlLink tetris  game. Finally reached the target of 60 pieces per minute after 3 days ; had a bet with a net friend she thought i couldnt do it but i proved her wrong !  OMG I just realised i really need to get a life....  I will not be working with my sis at her hotel after all, she told me there aren't any vacancies left anymore at the moment and asked me to try the banquet deparment ...but audrey told me that that being a banquet waiter is a much tougher job for the same pay , u serve much more people and the trays are much heavier....Well maybe i will just give it a try, see how .\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      A net friend of mine finally met her net friend who came all the way from USA just to see her ! And they totally clicked and he's now gonna come down here to work so that he can be with her. I'm really happy for her, hope it works out for the both of them. I was worried for her before she met him cos was well cos online relationships can never substitute for the real thing in my opinion , u could totally click with someone over the net but that doesnt mean u will be as compatible in real life , i learned that the hard way.   Well my dad is starting Xmas early this year by playing Santa Claus, hes giving away my old pc to my aunt for free eventhough she already has 1...i wanted to keep the hard disk (cos its brand new) and install it in my dell PC but well he wouldn't hear of it.  Well thats my dad, always puts others before family.  \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      A dready day where it rained like the whole damm day and its still raining now so i was stuck home alone. Downloaded and watched 'Rock Star', a movie starring Mark Walberg and Jennifer Aniston. Marky Mark plays this guy who is so obsessed with his fav band Silver Dragon that he sets up a cover band that plays all their songs note for note. Then when the vocalist of Silver Dragon leaves the band he gets the chance to lead it but he soon finds out that being a rock star isn't all its cut out to be. A pretty decent movie but nowhere as good or as memorable as Almost Famous, another 'rock' movie.   Alright a friend of mine is selling cookies , 50 cookies for 18 Singapore dollars so anyone who wants to purchase them for CNY or something email Hanna at chemohans69@pacific.net.sg for further details. Also orders for Valentines day will be at 10 dollars for a bottle of cookies (ard 30 pieces ) \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      So i went to the ***** office yesterday to look at the job offer. I would be a paid 2k a month for a year (training allowance) with no CPF or benefits ; basically its like an industrial attachment for 1 year. After which if my performance is up to Sun's standard then I would be hired as a permanent employee of ****** otherwise I would have to look for other employment.   But in my opinion I think its a good opportunity because ****** is a relatively new field in IT technology and not a lot of people are like trained in it (as far as I know) so even if I do not get hired by Sun after that year I should be able to get employment somewhere else easily. But of cos I'm gonna work my pants off to impress them during this 1 year so that they will keep me.   The only thing that sucks is that my workplace is gonna be at Nanyang Technological University in Boon Lay which is like at the opposite end of Singapore from where I live so I am looking at around 3 hours of travelling time a day to and from the workplace. Maybe i might stay at my sister's place in Woodlands for the weekdays if she doesn't mind have to talk to her about it.  Oh ya i think i was quite lucky to get this job offer cos I believe i was not one of the 6 originally chosen for this position. When i went there yesterday i went for the briefing with another TAP (Training and Attachment Program) group for another company (ST Technologies) . i was the only one there for the job at ******. After the briefing i asked the briefer(?) why that was so and he told me he already gave the briefing to the other Sun job candidates a week ago. So i'm quite sure that the only reason i got called up was maybe because one of them refused the job offer or was unable to take it. Well its a lucky break for me so I feel that i gotta take it!   Here is an  urlLink article  at CNET about my job scope if you guys wanna take a look. ******* was the guy who interviewed me and Im pretty sure I'm one of the 6 engineers mentioned there who would be working with the 3 research scientists.\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Great news!! A lady from *** called me regarding the job at *** and asked me to come down to their office at Raffles Towers tommorow so that they can give me the offer letter with the contract details and stuff. I have been jobless for like 9 months liao and it was really getting to a point where it was really embarassing to mention to people so can imagine how glad i was when they called me. Well still not sure how the pay is gonna be like but hopefully its reasonable , but i'm just excited about working in such a big company like *** so let's see what happens tommorow ! \r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\t \r\n      Note to self : Stop complaining about people in your blog you dumbass.

I calculated sick days left this year, vacation days available and figured that I have alot of better opportunities to use my sick days. Plus, not selling for a few days gave me a case of the guilts. Like how am I gonna make any cash if  I'm sitting on my ass at home? So, out the door I went, and yes, a decent sale did come along for me, about 5 minutes before closing time. Cha ching $$$$! Hopefully, after a couple days of vegging out here at home, I'll be ready to kick some major  retail ass on Wednesday. Life is still good!

I get to Perkins restaurant to observe, (and photograph), this huge mountain they (6 of them) had built, out of over 2,400 creamer cups! College town entertainment at it's finest. Perkins was nice enuff to give them all free drinks for accomplishing this fete......and entertaining their customers for an hour and 1/2.

See, I haven't sold a damn thing at work for three freakin' days now. We work on comission, so indeed this is not making me a happy girl. I fact, I'm a really pissed off  chick right now.  Back to my problem. I planned on blowing tomorrow off, using a sick day, and making a nice three day retreat for myself. I feel I deserve it......the scum suckers I work with do this shit all the time! Not me....the nice girl. The thing is, since I've had such a lousy sales streak, do I buck up, go in and try to make some moolah....or do I take the day off and get a much needed mental vacation? Guilt is kicking in here. Damn. the angel on one shoulder says, \"go in and give it another shot...tomorrow might be your lucky day. Strap on some balls lady.\"(Now I doubt that actual angels use the word \"balls\" in their vocabulary, who knows)  Then the little devil on the other shoulder is saying, \" Call off and stay home and regroup.Your job sucks and you need some time to chill. Strap on a set of balls lady!\"  Both are valid, and tempting. I dunno.I'll probably call in sick. Just making the decision is making me ill.

Funny you think of yourself as cozy calm comfy.......the people I work with have heard many stories of you and call you my wild crazy neighbor... and they do ask about you. OK I do imbellish a story now and then but Luv, nobody deserves my story telling more than you. By the way.. I did see you out naked the other nite......LOL  you really should put sompfin on that ass when you hook the dog out!!  Well guess by now you are pissed and will come knocking on my door.....hope so the coffee is always on for you. Hitting the hay now.. nitey nite Dear.

And other times, I'm really happy that it's comfy and predictable. I would make a very good Gemini. Glad I'm not one though, as I live with one and they are freakin' nuts! Like two nuts in one. Anyway, as I was making my way to Wal Mart tonight, I started thinking how simple and kinda mundane my everyday happenings are. I live in a very quiet area, in a little cottage by a lake. I go to work each day, always arrive on time, never break the rules, put in my hours and head straight home afterwards. On my days off, I clean the house and try to cook a couple of decent meals. In my free time, I'm working on my sites, reading or gardening. Napping and daydreaming....ya, I do alot of those too. I try to always put my hubby and son before anything else. I have one best friend...she lives on the other side of the trees. Really, she does. Most of the time, I just love this way of life.......slow and easy. Predictable. Cozy. But at other times, I long for the excitement of a time long ago. Living on the edge, in the fast lane. I was a blurr. Constant motion, never knowing where fate wouild take me. The funny part of it is, when I was in that place, I kinda longed to be right where I am now. Could this be a mid-life crisis? I don't think so. Just a mid-life reflection. It's kinda fun to think about the wild and crazy times....no responsibilities, just freedom. But to be honest, I wouldn't go back there for anything. I love my cozy, comfy place. Predictable as it is.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>27,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      It took me an hour and a half just to make everything look the same.

I must admit I've been learning alot along the way, but by no means am I even close to knowing even a fraction of what others know. I know enuff to get me by, and that's fine for now.

Decide to make major comfort foods for dinner. Stuffed peppers, mashed potatoes and green beans. I'm doomed to fat-assdom. I am sooooo weak!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I need to go on a diet  big time . The job I'm at now is making me fat.....all we do is munch all day long. Boredom I guess. Then there's the acess to all the fast food places, that you can hit with a rock from where I work.  shit. My house is also filled with goodies able crush any willpower I may have. I need to move to freakin Siberia to lose any weight around here. And to make matters even worse...I hate to work out. I'd like to get in shape by Spring, as I feel that's a realistic time frame. Now all I need is the motivation. I don't know what I'm gonna do.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I think that it is in my best interest to post before Karma kicks my butt (in more ways than one).  I believe I must be the one \"up the tree\" so to speak, as Karma must be to the \"right\" of the trees and Tricia to the \"left\".  Aw hell, I guess I'll just make a nest up here in the branches and be comfortable, ha ha.  This is my first post here, and I'm drawing a bit of a blank at the moment as to what to write (probably has to do something with my long day).  I want to thank Karma for inviting me to post here, I find it very flattering.  I guess what I might be able to offer (for better or worse) is a younger point of view - though I think my comrades here are just as young as me, in heart!  I can't promise I'll always be entertaining or insightful, but I'll do my best.  More to come later - after I get some sleep and can think strait!  Night all!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I'm having alot of trouble blogging tonight, as I think I'm suffering from \"brain block\". Not simply writers block, as my whole mind seems to be jammed up. It just doesn't want to put together thoughts in any manner that will make alot of sense. In fact, it just doesn't wanna think....period. The fact that I'm writing this is a miracle in itself. I think I'm just dead tired. I hope so. Either that, or I've just become a dumbass. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>23,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Today was Monday.......and after a 4 hour nap I think I am past my Saturday nite party....which is the subject I guess of this rant.  Ok I dont drink that often, and now I understand why. I have lost two days just recovering...It was a going away party for my boss. Of course it had to be the boss I liked. So that leaves me to face a perv boss and an asshole boss. Think I will take the perv over the asshole. Guess it's like anyone... we all have that asshole to deal with. I suppose its good to i.d. him right up front but damn.. why doesnt he realize what an asshole he is and make all our lives a bit nicer. At least he was smart enough not to join the party. Kudos to my asshole boss. So now the last purpose of my entry tonight.. the group of us leave the party to go to another bar.. not sloppy drunk.......yet.  So 15 of us walk in .. all white or mostly white.. with two black girls.. This bar had the gall to not serve the blacks l was with......I thought it was the year 2001........l am like what the fuck?  So I am telling all l know, not to go to this redneck, not even funny bar. I hope they go down the tubes fast as shit. Can l be sued for slander if I post their name? Last thing l want is to give them more advertising. Call me Karma and I will tell you where to avoid.  Well guess l need another nap to recover some more.......shit it's a bitch getting old.  Nap hell.....l am going to bed! Nite all.......sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.... \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>23,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      What a glorious day today was! The sun was out all day and the temp. was in the mid 70's....a perfect day for daydreaming and being lazy-minded. The leaves are slowly turning autumn colors, and a few are starting to fall here and there. I really love this time of year. I realized today, that I really need to get back to reading again. I love to read all sorts of books, but I seem to slack off during the warm months, and resume again around this time of year. I really am a creature of habit, I guess! I joined a great bookclub about two years ago, called  One Spirit Book Club. Their books are all newage reads...from yoga and meditation to herbal remedies and dream books. Anyway, I have alot of catching up to do, as I have a few books that I haven't even cracked open yet. Time to make some steaming orange spice tea, (with a bit of honey!), grab the cozy blanket and curl up on the sofa for a bit. Sounds good to me.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>22,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Ahhhhhhhh. A sunday, and I'm off work. Nowhere to go, and all day to get there. This is good....real good.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>22,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I layed downf or a bit after dinner, as I could not seem to shake the headache I had brought home from work. I fell into a deep, deep sleep, and had some really crazy dreams I'll tell ya! I don't dream that often (at least that I'm aware of), so when I do, I really enjoy them as they unfold. Unfortunately, I was startled awake and kinda bummed that I had exited from my dreamland adventure. I wanted to go back so badly. Did that ever happen to you? You awake from a dream and try to hurry back to resume where you left off? Never works for me. I hate that.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>21,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      OK......OK.........she begged me enough... so here it is. My entry.......now I have to think.. and hey.....thats not my style. Oh shit.. forgot I don't have a style either. I was telling Karma tonight that I had to deal with John Q Public again today. A word to the wise.. when inquiring over the phone about an order you have made...you don't know what \"race\" your talking about so don't slam a whole race. Remember I am in control of your order!! I believe John Q is going to get her order sometime after christmas. Lifes little victories... sometimes can't be celebrated but the silent revenge is sometimes best of all.... oh yeah... she is waiting for it to arrive Monday.... so much for closing the  boarders to the likes of me! LOL  Well that was my rant on the races today.. I think I need to hit the hay now.... Siesta time! LOL  later everyone.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>21,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I had a bit of fun tonight. At least it was fun while it lasted. I visited the chat area over at  urlLink surreally  to say say Hi (seeing as I'm a \"new kid on the block\"!) and kinda introduce myself. Thought it would be fun to chat with the people behind a site that I really enjoy. Anyway, it was fun until I got transported to this black \"void\" and didn't know how in the hell to get back!  I finally got back to the chat somehow...only to lose contact again. I don't know if it's my PC or what. It's probably me hitting the wrong button (not hard to do as there are many). I just need to figure out a plan to get out of the \"void\". Or how to avoid the \"void\". Nice people over there indeed. You just need a version for clutzes like me! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>21,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Talked to Tricia on IM tonight.......begged her to post!  I miss her wit and charm. Needless to say, it felt good touching base again. So close, yet so far. How true. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>21,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Today was an emotionally draining day at work....and it didn't involve the attack in any way at all. I must have a look that compels people to tell me all their problems, anytime...anywhere. Like in the mattress department, today at work. I was helping a sweet, timid woman purchase a bed and a mattress, when the next thing I knew the conversation turned from a delivery date, to how she was abused by a guy in California, she fled with her kids and dog across the country, only  to have her kids and dog taken away, because someone  thought she was emotionally unfit to keep them. She has tried to commit suicide twice....the last time a few weeks ago. She's trying to pick up the pieces of her life, one day at a time with the help of local womens groups, etc. God she sat there and cried and thanked me for listening to her. How could I not listen to her story? The poor thing lives in fear, as the ass who hurt her is looking for her.(she even showed me her protection order.) I gave her a big hug as she left,(I've given alot of hugs too)  and told her that she is strong, and a great person, and to stop in and see me anytime, if only to chat a bit. I went outside after she left, puffed on a cig and just shook. I felt her pain in every word she said. I felt them to the core of my being. I was happy to see, that when she left, she at least had a bit of a smile on her face...happy with the purchase she just made for herself......and maybe a bit more hopeful that things are going to be ok. The sales lady said so. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>20,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I was up waaaaay too late again. I believe it was almost 3 am when I finally headed to bed........not good, considering I have to work today. Web logs and blogging have turned me into an insomniac indeed! I'm addicted. Hell, I get home from work and I don't even change my clothes....say 'Hi\" to the family, then check the sites. I'm sure there are therapy groups for this disorder.On another note, I'm kinda excited, as I have invited another friend to join my Trees group. I think she will add a fresh outlook on things, as she is quite a bit younger than Tricia and I, and I think it will be fun to have her musings here with us....er should I say, me? I hope she will be sending us a post here any day. Well, gotta head off to the \"Grind\" for another fun filled day with the co-workers that I lovingly call the \"clowns\". Adios!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>20,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       New meaning to \"TV Land\" Oh where, oh where has Tricia gone? Did she get sucked into the T.V. like in Poltergeist??? I dunno. All I do know is, if that's the case, it's going to be really akward taking a 27\" T.V. to the chinese buffet with me on our \"girls day out\". *rolls eyes* Geeeez.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>19,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      You can put your message of hope and support on the  urlLink ABC News Ticker in Times Square .\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>17,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I  put all the energy that I've been building up over the past few days to good use today....I cleaned like mad!  I've put off doing alot of basic maintence this past week, (uh, maybe even two weeks) so  today all hell broke loose on the domestic front. I feel so much better now that things are a bit neater. Not spotless by any means, but comfortably tidy. Martha Stewart wouldn't be impressed, but we all know I can't stand her anyway. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>17,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well I'm back from a little \" mental vacation \",and my head seems to be a bit clearer now. I needed time to just let this all sink in and try to sort it out in some way. It got to the point where I just couldn't read about it, listen to it or even discuss it any more. So I tried to find a quiet place each day, ( through a bit of meditation), and I cleared my mind and calmed my soul. I couldn't even sit down to blog, as all my words led, in one regard or another, to Tuesdays attack. There's nothing I could say, that hadn't already been said in a thousand different ways. Different people, different places, different pages....so different, yet all the same. Today I felt peaceful amidst the confusion. My thoughts turning toward more mundane, everyday kinda things...a welcome diversion indeed. I feel the need to funnel all my energy into showing extra care and concern to all the people in my life. No matter what the context. Perhaps I've started my own type of rescue effort, in my own little corner of the world, with what I have the power to affect and change...now. I've changed how I love, how I forgive, how I listen, and how I live. I know I can't change the whole world, but I can have a positive effect on those I see everyday.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>13,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Let's get busy!  I know that in speaking for myself, (and I'm sure others as well), over the past couple of days, I have run the gambit of emotions. From shock and terror....disbelief and fear....anger then numbness. Now I'm at the point where I want to do something...something that will help make a difference for someone. Now, I'm in no way a rich person, but that doesn't matter here, because even small gestures, done by millions, can produce tremendous results! So there are lots of ways that we can rally together and help those that need us. I've included a link in our side-bar for donations to the Red Cross. All donations (100%) will go to disaster relief. Contact your church or local city agency. Alot of them are collecting not only cash donations, but other items that are needed by the rescue people and/ or victims families. Giving blood is a great idea, although alot of blood banks are saying that they have enough right now, so it might pay to wait a few days. Give the blood bank a call....they'll tell you their status. And send up a prayer....for those lost, for those hanging on to life, for those waiting, for those grieving, for the rescuers, for our Armed Services, for our Leaders, for our planet, for all of us. Peace. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>12,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I have been reading the posts of fellow bloggers over the past couple of days, and I must say, that amidst all the grief, pain, disbelief,  feelings and views being expressed, it is awe inspiring to see everyones true spirit of community, rising as one, united in helping eachother deal with, and hopefully get through this terrible tragedy. From shore to shore, border to border and across the world, we feel the same pain, a shared pain, regardless of color, sex, religion, status, age. And we want to reach our hands, and hearts out to our Brothers and Sisters...be it by a glance to a passing stranger that says \"I feel the same way too\", or a shoulder to cry on, or a message in a strangers comment box that says \"I'm sorry, my thoughts and prayers are with you\", or giving blood...the list is endless. For a few days now, we have put our personal needs aside, and we are looking at the needs of our fellow  American Brothers and Sisters.........we need to carry on this crusade long into the future. For us and for future generations. It's very sad that it took an event of this magnitude to bring us all together as one....one heart, one mind, one spirit, one goal....united and powerful. I am proud to be an American, and I am proud of  all the citizens out there everywhere , pulling together as one,  during this devastating time in our history. Together we are strong. United we stand.....divided is not an option.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>12,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      In the next few weeks things will be a bit out of control emotionally.. When opening my mail yesterday 9/11/01 I find this letter from a self help author whom I highly respect and feel it may be of some help....please read and share with your friends...and enemies alike...   When a catastrophic event like this happens, powerful feelings may arise. So I offer this: Don't give any more power to a small group of people almost certainly zealots of some kind whose twisted psyches (along with self-sacrificial devotion to their dark illusions).If this had been a tornado or earthquake, it would have represented a magic blip in nature's enigmatic scheme. But this was personal; human  beings did this deliberately to other human beings. And some of us are reacting exactly as they wished -- to bring the entire country to a halt, and to create waves of paralysis much farther-reaching than the localized damage caused, generating reactive shockwaves all over our country (and the world).   This catastrophic series of events remind us that while we cannot control circumstances in the world or in our personal lives, we can choose how we will respond. None of us can (or should) stop or control our natural emotional reactions, but we can help thwart their nefarious intent by controlling our behavior -- by responding in our circle of friends with compassion and calm. These people can only succeed in bringing our lives to a halt with our cooperation. Let's not give them power over our psyches; let's not serve their goals. Let's remember to breathe deeply, to relax our bodies, and to focus on the present moment, doing what needs to be done.Historically, this attack may rank with Pearl Harbor -- and when our country is roused, it becomes a giant, and some kind of justice will prevail. What form that \"justice\" may take is difficult to predict. One thing is certain; out of every adversity or challenge comes new lessons  and growth.  In the coming days and weeks, this event will become a topic of intense conversation (and action in appropriate quarters); the dead will be buried and grieved; the injured cared for; the FBI, CIA and other military activated. You and I will go on with our lives.Let's pray for those who need it; let's accept our emotions without letting them disable our clarity; let's keep our hearts open, even to the waves  of pain; and let's resolve to do what we can, in our own humble ways, to help create a world of understanding, compassion, courage, and love -- beginning with ourselves.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>11,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      silent tears...... silent prayers..... for those taken away...... for those that love them.... for those that try to save them..... for those that protect us........for all of us.   * I will not be posting here for a few days out of respect for those who lost their lives today. *\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       This site is now able to be viewed by the visually impared!

No. No way, nada, no how, by no fuckin' means. I'm a tad bit ruffled and I just feel the need to all out vent....just for a bit (so bear with me).  Screw that...I'm totally pissed and I want to let it out here, cause this place is the cause of my attitude malfunction. Not only has it taken me forever to get to this friggin' place...when did get in...all royal hell breaks loose! *lights another cig* ( I think I smoked a pack just trying to get to my blog, for cryin' out loud!) Anyway, no matter what I've tried to do, some cyber fuck-up decides that it isn't meant to be. Now I fully realize that this is not qualified as a literary 911 emergency....like I need to post the final procedure in a brain surgery operation to a surgeon with sporatic memory loss. No fuckin' shit!  But damnit I should be able to sit down and knock off a few sentences in a shorter time than it took to give birth to my son. Well, all the bugs (or whatever) are still not worked out yet....like why all my fonts keep changing  here. Hell, that's a whole nuther' bitch fest in itself. Well, I do feel a bit better now...thanks for bearing with me.....maybe tomorrow I'll have better luck.

So I don't know if I will be posting.......it means I get to use the big T.V. all by myself. Now I realize men don't think a woman can handle a remote of that magnitude but being the adventurous one I am going to try it out. See why it has to flip through all the stations at each commercial. I am amazed the the manufacturers have not come out yet with a remote that can stay on the same station for more than 5 minutes. Hey, maybe I will invent it and become rich!! Yee Haa.. my ship has come in! Too bad I am at the airport....yeah I know old joke. What can I say.. having got up early on my day off it seems very late and I cannot be held responsible for bad humor. Another reason its nice to have the big kid gone... I can sleep in tomorrow..my last day off. It is beyond me why we even have to leave the comfort of our beds on our day offs.  If it were up to me I would have a little frig for my nite table and then I wouldn't have to get up all day. Hmmm I know there has to be another invention in there somewhere. Like a headboard that would open to reveal a frig full of snacks. What good is a headboard anyway? Not like you can lay your head on it.....course I guess you have to have someplace to tie the ropes to. LOL.... see you all later.

Well it seems we lost our comment  link for awhile, and it totally drove me buggy as to what the problem was. Let it hereby be known, that I am in no way, shape or form, a computer genius! In fact I'm not a genius at all....in any realm...what-so-ever. Shit, I've diverted from the main topic here (I do this alot!) Anyway, I finally found out that Reblogger was down for a bit, and all I had to do was change the coding in my template, and all would be well again in \"comment land\".  I did get the comment links up again, but I lost all the freakin' comments.  *frown* Hopefully this won't happen again any time soon. I didn't post anything yesterday, as I was totally burned out after work. So I basically crashed out before 11. No urge to speak, listen, type, think.

Sometimes its all you can do to drag your ass out of that warm bed and get ready for work. Some days you roll over .. take a look.. and jump out of bed. Quick shower, throw on some clothes and off to work. I know it drives the men nuts to see us put makeup on in the car so I have begun to make a habit of it.. and on some mornings can even manage a cell call while doing it....driving? oh yeah I can keep it near my lane too. This morning promised to be a long day.. so thinking fast I put on jeans and sneakers.. a no no at work.. hoping to be able to pick up my paycheck and be sent home for inproper attire.....well shit guess what day it was....come to work casual......figures dont it? On my way I stop and pick up the same guy everyday.. he's pretty cool usually. Today he comes out in his boxers and says he will be ready in a few. I sit and wait....for a man.. whats wrong with me anyway. He hops in the car singing Bob Dillon....well ok sure it will stop in a few.................................hundred miles!!! I let him go only cause he was drunk and having a hell of a time.. started rubbing off and i begun to feel better .. or perhaps I was nearing intoxication on the fumes. Whatever the case .. the man, myself and bob dillion survived the day. Paycheck..........dont make me laugh... its only 9:30pm and its already gone..... have to wait another two weeks now.......or maybe the government will send me another check to help them with inflation. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Holding out on me?!!       Hey Karma you didn't tell me you were planning a sea side retreat... always more fun if you bring along another couple.. and you know how well  the boys get along together!!  I am wondering if it would appear suspicious to pack a black dress? Oh hell if I wait we can go on shopping spree together...now theres the ticket!  Look out folks we are in morning and mean to snap ourselves out of it if it takes all day.   Now thats taken care of I am taking my turn to vent on J.D. Public.... being in customer service as I am.....LOL.....shiit its more like being the company scape goat.. anyway, I come into contact with the most \"unusual\" people I have ever met. Why is it on the phone you (Mr. J.D. Public) feel you can rip a person to shreds because of some screw up you made? I can't help it if you can't stop your spending habits. Shit I know that if I spend $3,000.00 on an item.. I will save the receipt.. and I will remember who I owe my ass to. You call me and say you need to send a payment to a bank thats three months overdue but you don't know which bank....you don't know your damn phone number... worse was the man that said \"right now, I am at a different pay phone, I don't remember the other payphones number\". Then he had the gull to yell at me? I think not. It was indeed too bad I develope sneezes and disconnect each and everyone of you jerks. Want to call and bitch me out.....stand in line.. but don't worry .. it shouldn't take too long to disconnect the calls. Ever hear that...please stay on the line.. your call is important to us.........LOL think again.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>05,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Can't get enuff.... Wow! I am really amazed. I was out surfing today, and my eyes were truely opened to the wide variety of really remarkable web-sites that are out there, just waiting to be enjoyed by all. I know most of you are probably already aware of this phenomenon, but I, being rather new to all this, had NO idea!  Speaking of wonderful sites, I'd like to thank  urlLink surreally dot com  for their link to us, and the mention of us on their page! Their site is always fun and interesting, and I really enjoy the interaction between all the writers there. Also, their layout is nicely done and very easy on the eye.  Stop in and pay them a visit! And while you're there, check out some of the links on their site. You're in for a fantastic journey! Lata. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>05,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       D(m)ental Abuse???  Went to the friggin' dentist this morning........go in to have a cap glued back in. Now I feel like I need a damn therapist! Let's start off by saying that I'm about as far away from a morning person as you can get. Personally, I find those perky mornin' people obnoxious, and I pretty much just wanna bitch-slap em' when they get around me with their happy morning bullshit. Mornings suck here in La La Land......Nuff said 'bout that. So I guzzle my coffee and head out, thinking this should be an in and out kinda thing. WRONG! I get in the chair, and my dentist comes in and says, \"By the way, I'm not practicing anymore. Meet Dr. Bla Bla (I wasn't comprehending all this), he'll be taking over for me.\" Well, okay I guess....like what am I gonna say? Not like they asked my opinion on the whole matter! So on we go.....oh, oh.....looks like decay there too. Shit. Well, to make a long story bearable, drill, shot, more drilling, glue, bondo, more drill, head left, up, down, rinse & spit. All done? Hell no!  ...Another little cavity, lets fix that now. Hell, lets just wrack up the old platinum card...in fact, let's just make a whole day of it...I'll spring for lunch asshole! So we fix the cavity and they set me free. Well, can't go yet...the finance witch grabs ahold of me, and hits me with the damage to my pocketbook. It's a shame I have to tell hubby that he'll be living at the dentists house as a man-servent....bartering is the way to go I'll tell ya!  Well, I go out into the world broke,drooling and babbling (novicane in full force!) and praying to God that my hubby doesn't object to what I've packed for him for his trip. He did say for better or worse. If I don't post for a few days......hubby didn't find this amusing. Check garden....hint, hint. Lol!   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Am I missing something??  I don't know if I'm the only one wondering this, but............why do these people keep going into the water, when so many are being attacked by sharks???!!!  Especially your kids. I mean, I can see sending the old man out there to test the water....\"yeah, go ahead honey.....waters fine!  I'll be right out!\" Oops...where'd he go?? Anyway, what are these folks thinking? Last thing I'd wanna be doing is sending little Bobby out on a boogie board. Did ya ever hear of a pool? Cool off and still keep yur limbs...what a concept! Hey, I just thought of an crazy idea. Instead of a divorce....how 'bout a lovely weekend trip for two to Florida? Only one return ticket needed. Twisted, but good! C'mon, it's late.....gimmee a break!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,September,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Empty Trash Here...

Hell thats one way to tell Karma and I apart...shes the prim and proper one.. I am the one with orange and blue hair...not really planned but a kick all the same...Better see if I can get this posted before Karma as a blow out looking for me.

I'm Karma...1/2 of the hormonally challenged duo that will be writing here. Perhaps, in time, we'll add a few other mentally interesting people to the crew....but for now, I think we're all you're gonna need. I'm just your everyday kinda gal, living one day at a time in my own little world, that I lovingly call \"La-La Land\".  I don't break the rules...I just kinda bend em a bit...It's all good! I'm not famous, or popular. I don't make a ton of moola, although I act like I do. I love my family, close friends, my pets and all of nature. I'm a very artistic, (not autistic!) ,although I really haven't found a medium to best express my talents. Yet. I'm a bit middle-aged....but my spirit doesn't know this and I hope it never will!  Anyway...I hope to share my daily musings here, good and bad....wisdom or just plain ole crapola! My life isn't glamorous....but it sure as hell aint' boring. You'll see!

Today is your day to party, so dress up and party on! Or if you're just plain freaky as you are, don't dress up....just party down!! I still don't know what I'm gonna do tonight. It's raining out and damn cold.....I really don't fancy standing out there tonight freezing my ass off in my ghoul get-up. Not that I haven't in the past...been through rain, wind, even snow. We'll see....this has happened to me before. All day I'm dragging my feet about dressin up, then I change my mind, fly like a bat outta hell, get ready, and have a blast!  Maybe I'll dig out my cape and stuff and see what happens. Dunno. The cool thing is that most people fix their places up kinda \"cutsey\", but I'm one of the few that scares em' a bit and the kids get a kick out of it. So do the parents, really. Guess I'll go dig out my costume. Maybe that will inspire me to bring out my \"dark side\" once again this year. So maybe if you're out and about tonight, and you hear the leaves rustling behind you, and you feel something staring at your back from out of the shadows, and you catcha glimps of a dark figure lurking about in the cold, dark nightness...don't be too afraid. It may just be me, with my plastic pumpkin filled with Reeses cups. Then again, it may not.

I am back.. and hope after this weekend i will recover from the jet lag... or is it just too much party? Hmmm both i guess.  I am suppose to go out tomorrow nite to a party.....arghhhhhh....they are trying to kill me i think. Anyway my trip to the midwest was an enlightening experience. I always pictured sort of quiet backward farm people living there....My apology to each and every mid westerner. I would love to move there .........correction........I long for the time i can move there. The people there are so kind and nice. I am a yankee and talk too fast for them but hell i think i can drop the new york minute.. i hate rushing anyway. I worked 70 hours and partied just as many if not more....it was a chance for me to catch up on seven years of naught. LOL......it was fun... Karma you and I have to go on a road trip!!!  I did get lost out there easily.. without the lake to help me judge which way is north i was easily lost. I visited Iowa on a regular basis...LOL. Council Bluffs i believe. They treated my like a lady... .. almost forgot i was one. I am sorry that you had to fly solo here for awhile but i will try to do better hon..... i will tell you about the corn maze tomorrow!!!

I have always been a night person...I love the darkness, the moon and stars, things that lurk in the shadows. And needless to say, this time of year plays right into my love of the dark and mysterious. Cloudy, breezy nights. A chill in the air, and the moon casting shadows under the black, leafless trees. Kind of mysterious and spooky..............I love it. Daytime just doesn't have the same draw for me. I love my nights. Part of me leans towards the dark side. Not too far though. Just to the edge. Went over the edge, long, long ago. I'll never go there again. Ever. Even though I'm a bright, sunny kinda person...ever the optimist...part of me will always be drawn to the darkness. This time of year just brings it to light. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>23,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      It was a gorgeous fall day today, made even better by the fact that I'm on vacation. Love it! I slept in this morning till 11, and really did nothing worth while all day, except take our down comforter to the laundromat. Strange thing pertaining to doing laundry. I don't know about you, but stuff always disappears outta the dryer. I know this doesn't happen to me alone, as I have read about others experiencing the same shit. Well I'll be damned! It happens in the freakin' laundromat too! I put two tennis balls in the dryer with my comforter, (they beat the down while it dryes to fluff it), and only one came out!!!  WTF???? Now how the hell do you loose a tennis ball in a dryer?? Leave it to me. Enter my world....shit like this happens. One would think I'd be used to it by now. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>23,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Gotta go check out  urlLink zefrank .

It's not that I don't love fast food, casuse I do. But some cosmic influences are causing me to have bad experiences, almost every time I try to get a freakin order of fries or a burger. Consider my experiences in the past....go to Arbys, order roast beef sandwhich with horsey sauce on the side. Pay and pick up order, pull away approx. 15 feet or so to check bag. I discover that there's no sauce in bag and decide to back up to the window to ask for sauce. Backing up was my first major mistake. While watching the big yellow cement pillar hickeys in my rear view, I slam into the friggin metal counter with a loud crash, taking out my left tail light. Holy shit! Well like a good person, I glance into the window, nobody there.....bolt like a bat outta hell! I knew I didn't do any damage to the counter, so I figured since I was the \"damaged party\" I would just haul my embaressed ass outta there.  Tuesday, I head to Wendys for lunch. (figured I'd avoid Arbys)  I order, drive up to the window and hand the chickie a $10. Well, blondie let go of the bill and it goes flying up in the air and all over the parking lot. Now I can't just jump out of the Jeepster as I'm wearing a dress, and leaping over the shifter and out the side door was not an option. And I can't get out the drivers door, as I'm about 7 inches from her window. Patrons behind me are just sitting there, blondie is screaming, \"it's on top of your Jeep\", and flailing her arms. All this and I have to be back to work in like, ummm, 10 minutes ago. Well, this Wendys employee fellow pops out the side door to give another patron their dinner, and I jumped on the oppourtunity. \"Hey, you there, my money....grab it\" I yell at him, pointing to my ten spot doing another fly-by over-head. To make a long story short, he grabbed the bill for me, after a few acrobatic moves in the parking lot, and saved the day. I got back to work late, but the boss found my story amusing. (I'm sure he'll use the word amusing in my \"write up\".) Okay, on to Wednesday. I buzz by McDonalds just to grab one of their salad shakers...no biggie, right?? Yeah. Do the usual, pay, pick up order, leave. I get over to work, open the bag, and the asshole gave me the wrong salad! I paid for the more expensive one and he gave me the garden salad. And no dressing to boot! Well, I'm starved and I have no time to run back over and correct the mistake,( boss wouldn't have found this story amusing....nah) so I ate it while fuming. So you see, I have tried to eat at many different fast food places, but the results are always the same for me.......bad karma. (no pun intended) So today I pulled out my insulated lunch bag, filled it full of goodies, and no drive thru window will I see. Of course, I haven't tried just going in and ordering....maybe I'd have better luck.......nah.       \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>16,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Not much going on in the ole cranium at the moment. Glad to have one lengthy day at \"the grind\" over with, one more to go, then all downhill from there. I put in for two vacation days next week. That will give me a nice five day stretch to do as I please......can you say..... be lazy?!! The  boss better not even give me any grief about it either, as I haven't taken any days since July and the morons I work with take days off like, every other week. I swear no one keeps track of their vacation days. Anyway, I'm looking forward to a nice stretch of \"I'm gonna sleep in and do whatever the hell I wanna do\"! Amen and goodnight! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>16,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Man I'll tell ya, Mother Nature does not piss around when she changes the seasons around here. At least when we go from summer to winter. Yeah, fall lasts about a week at best here. We don't mess around....a few leaves hit the ground, then BAM, snow! In fact we had a bit of snow last Sunday, not much, perhaps a 1/4 inch or so before it melted. Enough to get my ass in gear on Monday, and put all the patio and lawn stuff away. I remember a few years back when my son and I trick-or-treated in a flippin' blizzard! We raked in the candy though.....everyone felt sorry for us, and only 3 or 4 other people were out, besides us. Man, I was in chocolate heaven for a month! Well worth the frostbite. *Kidding!* Well, those winter winds came howling tonight..........and the temp. dropped like a rock. We have a joke here in the \"snow-belt\". We have two seasons...winter and waiting for winter. So, on that note, got my winter coat washed, gloves ready, boots lined up...............let er rip!    \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>14,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I think I have a great way to bring all this terrorism to a quick and casualty-free end. Crate up all the clowns I work with, air lift 'em over to Afghanistan, drop the idiots in the hills, wait a day or two, and watch the freakin' terriorists come a runnin'! No shit, these people could test the nerves of even the most hard core lunatics. I know, because I live through their twisted little, mind blowing antics every freakin' work day of the year. And I have the mental and digestive scars to show for it. No lie. I have a manager, who not only looks like, but manages like Hitler. Then there's the fella that farts every 5 freakin' minutes, then giggles & giggles; there's the neurotic socialite-wannabe, who imagines herself to have every illness known to man or is on the verge of getting one. After drinking green tea one afternoon, I told her that the side-effect would be that her skin would have a green tint for 24 hours. She spent the whole day showing everyone in the store her slowly \"greening\" limbs. Nut case. I got an ulcer because of this bitch.  Now we come to the chick that is so strung out on \"whatever\", that all she does is sleep all day, or when she is awake, and I use that term loosly, her eyes are half shut. She smokes, takes a 2 hour lunch, crashes out, the goes home. She hasn't been to work in like a month......heard she and a few friends got sloshed and rear-ended a parked car. Oopsie! Can you say DUI?? Ok, where was I? Another gentleman (or lack there of) I work with is referred to as \"super perv\". Gawks at young babes all day, making lewd remarks, etc. You get the picture. Every womans dream guy. Ugh. New guy is a stutterer. Now I know that he can't control this affliction, and his stuttering is not the main source of aggrivation. Fact is, he's a hyper stutterer. Shit, there's nohing like having someone running aroung like they're strung out on coke, while  trying to talk to you and they freakin stutter. We also have \"bitch and moan\". All this guy does, 24/7 is complain about everything! He makes up shit if theres nothing to bitch about. Hates his job, the wife, the traffic, on and on and on. To make a long story bearable, we also have: the manic depressant, the office slut/ valley girl (ya know), a fella from the \"hood\" who sings \"My Girl\" all damn day, and a host of  other amusing oddities that I call co-workers. So you see, I believe I have the perfect arsenol right here at my disposal. Free of charge, I can have em ready to go in a moments notice. Toss a few snacks in the crate, a case of beer or two, a blow up doll for perv boy, and they'd be filing in there pronto. A few nails, a one way ticket.....see ya!!  There's plenty of room in the crate, so if anyone has a co-worker or two to contribute, bring em on. The more the merrier. When in doubt....send in the clowns! (can you tell it was a long day??) \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>13,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well my cover is blown.. now everyone knows who to blame for their gateway problems.......I am sorry Karma that I have not come by.. truth is I have been painting.. ceilings no less. So glad walmart is near.. keep running out of paint. Who ever invented open concept living didnt have to paint ceilings. I am busy packing for my trip.. had to wash everything first... sure hope its more fun than work.. as i am packing all my fun clothes.. lol While i am in Omaha I thought I would look for the bunker that Bush went into and try to get a pic....before they arrest me for getting too close. Well i promised i would blogg and will try when i am out of town.. but dont promise that one. See you all in a week.. bye.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>12,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I ran into tricia the other day, and after she appologized for the lack of posts, she explained that she is going to Omaha for a week. She works for Gateway, and they are sending her there for training. Training sucks, getaway for a week....priceless! Enjoy.  I still think it's a lame excuse for not stopping in and at least saying Hi. I mean, how busy are you? Do you have to build the friggin' plane you're taking, or what?? Are you painting the house before you go?? What!!??  I'm brutal, I know, but I love ya! *wink* \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, I'm feeling a bit better than I was on Wednesday. Hell, I felt like I was gonna die or something. I seem have a problem where health issues are concerned....like I don't deal with them very well. In fact, I don't deal with them at all. I find myself at this stage somewhere between I'm young and nuthins' gonna happen to me, and, oh shit...everythings wrong with me. Usually I just try not to dwell on the little things. All of us have our aches and pains and such.......nothing that a bit of ibuprophen (or vicodin) can't smooth over. But then at times, like after I see enuff cancer and heart disease ads and stories, I'm like \"oh my God, maybe I have that shit!!\" So you see, I can  swing from let's pop a Tylenol... to call the mortician, quick.....in a heartbeat. Most of the time I just try to stay in a comfortable state of medical denial. I'll probably regret it someday. Anyway, for now, I am feeling better. Better living thru chemicals, indeed.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Sorry 'bout lack of posts. Past couple of days I've been feeling like garbage....headaches, fatigue, eyes bugging me (I need glasses bad!) Anyway, I think I need to re-group here, and start taking better care of myself. This mid-life bullshit is for the birds, I'll tell ya!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>09,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      \"If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is there to hear it, did it really make a sound?\" Hmmmm.

The air is crisp, but not cold. Love this shit! I went to \"The Wal\" yesterday, and bought our pumpkin and a pretty wreath of silk flowers for the door. Looks very nice indeed. I love our pumpkin...kinda lop-sided with a few dents here and there (kinda like me!) I never go for the perfect ones...they always get chosen. I think this obsession to always pick things that are a bit different from the \"norm\"  stems from school...I never got picked to be on the teams for dodge- ball, etc. Like the last choice. Ugh. So I always feel sorry for the underdogs, so to speak. Anyway, I'm headed out into this wonderful day, to get a few things done in the yard and enjoy a bit of sunshine while I'm at it. Man I could go for a slice of pumpkin pie right about now. Yummm!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>07,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I just figured out today, that I am a \"lazy ass\" with good intentions. When I'm at work, and everyone is talking about our upcoming days off .....I'm just as into the \"gotta get shit done around the house\" as they are. Oh yeah! I need to clean up the yard, straighten up the house, wash the dog, bla, bla, bla. Then I get to those wonderful days off, and suddenly my resolve to conquer the dust bunnies wanes. Hell, it goes right out the damn window, into the yard that is waiting to be tended to. Now don't get me wrong, it's not like I get home for a few days and don't do anything. Oh, I saunter around and do a bit of this, and a bit of that. Wipe up here, sweep there. But those visions of \"Martha-dom\" elude me. Ok...I think the washer stopped. Screw it. It'll wait. I wonder what new sites I can find tonight? \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>07,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      It looks like I'm in a big snowglobe........it's  snowing like a bitch outside. Big, big flakes. And it's laying......yikes!!!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      It's Sunday morning, and it doesn't get any better than this. Saw Hubbs and Ron (my brother-in-law) off a bit ago. Heading down to \"The Burgh\"....Ron going home and Hubbs staying the night as he has business down there tomorrow. So here I am, enjoying a day of \"me time\". Nice. Actually I have three days off, but I have plenty to do around this place. Gotta get my ass outside and \"winterize,\" as Mother Nature doesn't seem like she's foolin' around this year. Damn it's cold, and those dark, winter clouds are just zooming along overhead. So wether my patio furniture is put away or not....winter is on it's way! Around here, it's either Winter or waiting for Winter. Lovely to live in the \"snow-belt\". Well, I popped a few cd's in our new stereo a bit ago, and I must admit it sounds really nice! Our old stereo didn't have a cd player, so I either had to listen to my cd's in the Jeep or my sons room. Not very convenient. Anyway, I feel like a kid at Christmas with my new \"toy\". And I am gonna enjoy my day today......just me, a few cd's and a hot mug of Orange Spice tea. Yummm. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Celebrate Halloween? Need a Platinum card!  Is it me, or has Halloween turned into a major retail bonanza over the last few years?! When I was a kid, we dressed up and went around to houses that had the paper cut-outs in the windows, and a nicely carved and illuminated pumpkin outside the front door. Today, it's a real \"keep up with the Jonse's,\" full blown, animated, illuminated gobblin bonanza, that starts in September! I've seen trailing lights, flashing ghosts of all shapes and sizes, whole front yards that look like a cemetery, fog machines, well you get the picture. Now I am in no way knocking these creative folks. Hey, if you want to bust your ass to hang up all this stuff, more power to ya!  All I'm saying is that it has gotten so commercialized...just like Christmas.  I live out in the sticks...no street lights, tar chip roads through the woods, spooky any night of the year. Halloween night it's  double spooky . I personally think that all this \"Vegas style\" Halloween decor takes away from the best fright doctor of them all...one's imagination.  Imagination is free. For everything else....there's MasterCard.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>03,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Need someone to \"kick your ass?\" Look no further! Never ceases to amaze me, the bizarre and twisted things that pop up on the web. While checking out  urlLink Backwash  , it amused me that I could bid on a  urlLink \"good ass-kickin \"! I don't even know how to comment on this one. (And NO the bid on there is not mine!!) Hell, I get my ass kicked everyday for free. It's called a job. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>03,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I am so jazzed! I bought a new stereo system yesterday.......a purchase that I feel has been  long  overdue. This one was advertised in the Sunday paper, at a store where I get my employee discount. I checked it out:  500 watts,  3 cd changer (that's all  we need), surround sound speakers, remote, all the fancy bells and whistles. Well by the time it was all said and done, I paid little more than the cost of small boombox for this sucker! I am a bargain hunter!  Love it. My son has it temporarily hooked up for me. W e have to remove the old one from its area, dust a bit,  then wire this one up properly. But you know how guys are. Just gotta get it hooked up and hear how it sounds. Duh, sounds like a radio. *smirk*  I officially haven't heard it \"cranked\" yet, but hell, anything will be an  improvement over the 20 year old fossil we had!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>03,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Just a lil' bitty post tonite.

Well, Baby girl is the person I'm gonna call if I ever feel like pissing with the coding on my sites again! No shit...I tried to add some stuff, ended up screwing the whole thing to hell and back, and then had to take 2 hours to get it all to look just as it did in the first freakin' place. Damn it. *shakes head in disgust* So from now on, any time I feel the need to be \"little miss freak around in the template area\", I'm gonna call Baby, and she's gonna yell, '\"do not touch the coding...just step away from the computer.\" Bless you Baby. Keep the pager on 24/7. Thanx! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>02,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Full moon? I sure hope so that would mean that all of today will end and the morning it will be all better.  I am a single parent that happens to be married. Shiit sometimes life isn't fair.. Son woke today claiming he was ill... ok mad dash at the last moment to find a sitter... I find one that can stay for an hour... calling again... find another that can stay for two hours... ok.. well hell at least I can get to work.. driving a car pool sucks!! I leave 20 minutes late and hit every tractor in the entire farming community. Ok now in town and all the red lights.....arghhh. Pick up the people I need..who are also running late.. all of us on edge.. I have to stop and get a card for the office to sign.. death of a grandmother of a co-worker...for a brief moment daydreamed of that peaceful sleep.......I did snap out of it in time to follow a city bus.....choke, cough, oh pewww -- the rest  of the way to work. Today was moving day. They moved our office, which means out of the 100 pc's lucky if 30 are working. Of course the first two I try don't work. Finding my groove and a pc that works now and settle in.  I feel a shadow looming over me... I look up to see a new trainee standing eagerly beside me...shiit. This is what I need today. He introduces himself.. a rather nicely built man....but not sure what his face looks like. He never raised his head above my bust line.......After a few hours they come and tell me that due to my sons illness i can go home! Happy to go home until i see son is up and running around.......hes not sick!!!! Load his lil butt up and drive him to school.....home again and its only 1p.m. My sister calls and she is having the dog put to sleep.. oh man..............i should have stayed in bed. I won't even go into the frogs escaping in my kitchen........arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Full moon indeed.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,October,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I am one happy girl!

Everyone at work just sapped my energy today, for one reason or another. I couldn't wait to get away from them. I felt so much better when I got home, went outside in the cool air. I felt like I could breathe again. I wasn't trapped anymore....... listening to their idiotic babble. On and on. I thought the day would never end. But now I feel calm and relaxed. When I go out into the cool  night air, and everything is quiet ,except for the rustle of wind in the trees, I come together again. I'm back in touch with me. I can think again....clear thoughts. One with the night. Goodnight.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>27,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I don't wanna be a grown-up tonight. I don't want to know that my Mom is in the hospital and having a bad time of it. I don't want to be my Mom's Mom. I don't want to go to bed again and ask God to make her well, like I have done for the past 40 years. I pray for her, but that's all I can do. I want to call my Mom with my worries, and hear her say that it will be allright. I've never known what it's like to do that, and I never will. I have to be the strong one, and right now I don't want to be. I don't mean to sound selfish, but sometimes even the strong need love too. I miss my Mom.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>24,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I feel angry, helpless and frustrated tonight. I try very hard to be a patient and kind person, and yet I feel like I continually get emotionally \"beat up\" all the time. Like certain  people think, \"Hey, she's a push-over, I think I'll just dump all my mental bullshit on her\". God I'm getting sick of it. Being a safe haven for everyone that has some sort of neuroses, is bullshit. Hey, like I have feelings too. I learned how to handle my bullshit, by my own self. The hard way.  Get a clue. Get a fuckin self-help book and read it. Get your heads outta your asses and grow up already. I did. I'm not your supreme life leader. I'm not Buddah and I don't have all the answers. When I offer em' you don't listen anyway. Why is it the people with the biggest mouths, know the least?   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>24,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       There's no place like home... I used my days off to get all our Christmas stuff up, and now I go back to work just as tired as when I left. I'm a tad bit frustrated too. I really do love putting all the holiday decor together, even though it is alot of work. I've done it solo for the past 20 years. But I gotta tell ya, it's starting to wear a bit thin anymore. It's getting to be a bit of a pain to work full time, run a house and be the Christmas freakin' fairy too. And then to add insult to injury, my not-so-helpful-elves ask, \"what's stressin' you out so bad\"? Are they brain dead or what? Now these comments are coming from people that on their days off do next to nothing. Hubbs golfs so much anymore, I'd like to wrap a club around his neck. And the teenager has to rest for 20 hours after working for 6. Sometimes I feel like Dorothy in the Land of Oz. Who are these weird people I'm with, where the hell's the Wizard, and how do I get home??  Help!!!!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>24,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I know I haven't been here in a few days, and for this I do appologize. But with the crazy holiday hours, I've been a step above dead by the time I get home, and the  last  thing I've felt like doing is sitting down and putting my thoughts here. You wouldn't have wanted to hear em anyway. Well, today was a new day............and a day off to boot. I was really into getting our Christmas stuff up, so I dug in and got a good start. I was soooo thrilled yesterday when I opend the new tree I bought on Saturday and it was perfect!! I mean, absolutely perfect! It's a 7 foot slim profile tree that fits just right in the small space we have. I was pretty bummed that our other tree wouldn't fit this year ( thanks to my computer desk) and there was no way that we were not gonna have a tree. A  table top tree was not an option here. Anyway, it's just right, and looks great already,  even if it only has lights on it at the moment. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>24,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Am I the only one who can mind my business and take care of myself yet get in to trouble for just breathing? I go over the top with taking care of everything yet and still....it is not enough. When is it my turn to get a break?  Hell I am working tomorrow and avoiding all the shit at home. Be damn glad to be at work too. Did i just say that?  think i need to start drinking.  As for the xmas shopping Karma.....yeah i mowed down three old ladies to get the cd player for your ungrateful ass.....think i will just keep it for myself now!!  Not! Karma is the greatest woman i know. I would pay full price.......maybe .....well if the line is really long and i have to get up at 6.....yeah shes worth full price.

For anyone working retail, this translates to \" I can't wait to start work at the butt-crack of dawn, and greet a crazy mob of bargain hunting lunatics, with little or no regard for their fellow shoppers, and keep a big smile on my face as they grab my shirt trying to get my attention, all the while saying Happy Holidays, and listening to White Christmas being played for the 100th freakin' time in 9 hours.\" And the season has just started. I personally think that all the \"America stands united\" stuff totally went out the window this morning, when they're standing at Wal Mart at 6am, anxiously waiting for the doors to open so they can get that $19.99 CD player for their best friend. Boy oh boy,  you'll be a big hero on her list when you tell her that you plowed down 5 old ladies while racing to the electronics department for that special gift. Go you!!  I guess all consideration for your \"fellow Americans\" goes right down the tubes when sales and bargains are involved.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>22,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Happy Thanksgiving. for the past couple of days I have been taking care of Karma's Queen.. the family pet. She is so sweet and so old and so frail looking. I Love her to death.. Tonight I left my dog out and went to Karma's to take the Queen out... lumbering as she does to the back yard I followed her.. feeling so sorry for this once scary as shit dog.....my dog hears us and breaks her chain coming over... the Queen still has it in her!!! She drug me all the way to Karma's front door after my dog. Of course chicken shit dog that I have ran like hell home. The Queen enters her home and stands looking at me with a smile* gotta love that old lady. Thanks for letting me care for the Queen.  On the topic of old woman...... I called my own mother to wish her a happy turkey day.... and you know what.......I can't remember hanging up the phone! I worried all day that I hung up while she was talking. I was scared I had a major brain fart and would prob soon fall over dead of a brain aneurysm.. (spelling left to the reader). After many hours of trying to reason what happened to the phone call I swallowed my pride and called her back. When I explained this to her she laughed and said she wished she had known she would have \"played\" me for all I was worth!  Come to realize my sister had taken the phone to say hello to her and when she was done she had hung up. I was busy doing the dishes and had not even noticed. So Mom say's \"had I known I would have called you back and chewed you out for hanging up on me, just to hear your reaction\"........like I don't carry enough guilt for the world.. Mom has to add to it whenever possible.......Gotta Love them old ladies.  Off to take my geritrol and climb into my posturepedic bed... nite all......\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>20,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Ya know, something just came to me. I think the reason I have a hard time designing web pages is because I don't have a \"geek-type\" brain. Now exactly what this involves, I dunno. All I do know, is that everyone that seems to be any good at this shit usually uses the word \"geek\" somewhere in their conversation. I hope this is not the case, as I don't aspire to become a geek in any way, shape or form. Since high school, geek doesn't really hold wonderfully positive imagery.  Still doesn't. I wonder if there is hope for me....a non-geek trying to make a web page. God I hope so.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>19,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      shit here we go with the guilt trip again... ok heres a post from me.

It's very hard to stay in this place, as outside influences fight to enter and disrupt the tranquility. I'm back to meditation again, as it keeps me centered and focused, although I don't do it as much as I probably should. There is so much stress related negativity in the air anymore, what with all that has happened over the past couple of months. Sometimes I feel like a sponge, in that I absorb the vibes around me. At times it can be overwhelming, like it has been lately, and that's when I need to retreat from it all for awhile and re-group. So for the time being I'm not reading the paper, watching the news or discussing current events. What is, is and what will be, will be. I will now find bliss in a hot bubble bath, a steaming cup of orange spice tea and a night filled with zzzzzzzzzzz's.  Ahhhhhhhh!

I don't have many, but just as with precious gems, only one or two is all you need to feel special. They are rare gems indeed, and they have a radience in their souls, that burns brighter than anything I've ever known. Or will ever know. They are fragile spirits, but strong souls, and my life has been made ever so magical because of their presence in it. Thank you for your beautiful gift of just being you, my friend. Thanks for sharing this journey we call life, with me. I just thought you should know. I just felt you needed to know.                        Love.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>11,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Crystal clear night, twinkling glitter stars dance above in the blackness.

Black is a blank slate....fresh and new. Untouched. This is where I begin. If you don't know what the hell I'm talking about, then so be it. If you do understand, then, you always have and you always will.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Tonight, no not just tonight actually, but for awhile now.....I feel the need to go deeper here. Past the usual bullshit.... work, home, holidays, politics, moods, etc. Bla, bla, bla. There's more going on in my head, and my soul,  but I just can't tap into it. I need to move others thoughts out, and dig deeper into my own.  I'm getting real bored, real fast with superficial ramblings. Tired of writing them....even more weary of reading them. I find nothing worth reading right now. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      She loses ten grand and i have a party for 7 nine year olds. Now who do you really feel sorry for? Me right? Well have to hand it to Karma shes out there really plugging away for the man... and her Vette.  I spoke to Krazy last eve and was straight up with her.....gotta be nice to her now........I think shes still in shock. I can be brutal sometimes. Not often but i have my moments. I am posting tonight cause i made a promise.. but after today i find myself exhausted and in dire need of more sleep. My body is wearing out fast. Dont fret............. the spirit is still nasty ass shit.....so dont even test me. Taking monday off work may post a surprise entry then.. who knows.. thats two days away.. i dont know from one day to the next what will be going on ..... we shall see....nite all\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Work today didn't start out well at all. Everything was fine and dandy till I hit the front door, then all \"commission hell\" broke loose. Joe informed me that the huge deal we were working on, had all but dwindled to nothing. These assholes have been pissing with us for a week now, and frankly we've had just enuff of their bull shit. The only thing that was keeping us civil was that they were spending ten thousand freakin dollars. Hell ya I'm an ass-kisser for ten grand. Then to boot, another deal I made, and delivered, didn't fit in the customers door, so they not only returned it, they decided there was nothing else they liked in the store. Another one bites the dust. So as you see, I started my day by losing a shit load of moolah. The day didn't get much better after that either.  *sigh* \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>09,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I had a revelation this afternoon. I will never be rich, thanks to Wal Mart and *insert any Dollar Store name here*. Thats the truth as I see it....the cold, hard fact. I can not walk into a Wal Mart or a Dollar Store and only get what I went in for. Never, never, ever. Although I must say the worst of the two is the Dollar Store. I mean, how can you go wrong when everything is a buck!!  Suddenly, shit I don't even need, becomes instantly attractive with a $1.oo sticker on it. My bank account is forever doomed.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Great, I have a friggin headache now. I was surfing the web a bit ago, just randomly checking out new sites, and I'll tell ya what.... some of the sites out there are enuff to give you an anurism. Just to navigate through some of their pages, takes longer than it took to build the Brooklyn Bridge, for gods sake! Ya get flash pages, twirling icons, flashing buttons, a gazillion links, all kinds of circus bullshit, just to arrive at.........Nuthin. No content. No brain cells firing here. Nada.  Now, by no content, I don't in anyway mean the folks that talk about their everyday lives and such. You don't have to be a Hemigway or a journalist to have a good, interesting, enjoyable site. I'm talking about folks that spew out their mangled brainwaves onto the web, and you can't even figure out what the hell they're talking about. (This is where I ran into trouble, I tried to make sense of the writings.)  Random incoherent sentences, meant to fry the brain cells, of the likes of you and me. Hey, if you're on a friggin' morphine drip, don't try to write a journal buddy. If you just put down your crack pipe, don't blog and screw up my cranium, as I try to find a shred of sense in your drug induced words of wisdom. And the bitch of it is, that you have to go through all the \"hypnotica\"  bullshit, to get to the \"no content\" part. So, after hitting about 10 of these entertaining sites, here comes the headache.  Needless to say, no new links will be added tonight. Advil please. Or better yet, pass the morphine drip.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      It was a beautiful, spring-like day today, and I really enjoyed the fact that I was home and being lazy on this pretty day. I ran into town for a bit, and stopped in at Earthshine for a look around. I haven't been there for awhile, and I felt like picking up a few tid-bits for myself. I bought some  urlLink incense , a pair of fairy earrings, a dragonfly earring and a beautiful fairy/crystal pendant. I just love browsing around in that store....kind of a hippie type store with lots off neat beads, jewelry, cd's, clothes, etc. I never leave empty handed, and the owner (I can't remember her name, but she's a sweetheart) always gives me a deal on whatever I buy. Super people indeed. Now it's  really  pissin' me off that I can't remember her name. Sheesh.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      First, I want to appologise for not bloggin' along with the group in so long.  Feel free to yell at me in the comments!!  It's all good though! I'm pleased to report I got my mom \"hooked up\" on the internet tonight.  Had to install a router and run some network cable, but she is up and running!  She's used to using AOL, so I think that getting acclimated to the regular \"web browser\" interface is a little new to her.  But I gotta give her credit - she's doing a great job.  I think she's just happy to be able to download MP3s again (her true love, LOL). Oh, and Nick's birthday party was great, even if it didn't go exactly according to plan!  Often, I think, those unplanned surprises are more fun anyway!!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Happy, Happy 19th Nick!!!!  Tomorrow is my son Nicks 19th birthday.... 19!!   Yikes , where has all the time gone?? It just  totally  blows my mind to think that I have a 19 year old son. After all, I sure as hell don't feel any older than that myself!  (well....maybe just a tad bit) I mean, it wasn't  that  long ago that I was 19. (well, maybe it was a little bit ago)  But all that aside, sheesh, things are moving way too fast here. It seems that when they're little, time just seems to drag it's feet....slowly moving from diapers, to training pants, to potty training to \"big boy undies\", all to the tune of lullabyes and nursery rhymes. Days spent playing, napping, watching TV and giggling.....blowing bubbles and watching Sesame Street. Like one long, flowing pastel memory, it just floats on by. Slow and easy. Then you hit the middle school and high school years, and all hell breaks loose!  Hormones break loose, the attitude kicks into high gear and it's just like that bumper sticker says...\"Get in, sit down, buckle up and hold on....it's gonna be a bumpy ride'\".  Amen.  Couldn't have said it better myself. A mom must have thought up that one, 'cause it describes the ride from 12 on perfectly. It's fast, it's furious and it sure as hell is bumpy. Now after around 15, things really get wild. Begin blurr here. You have a new driver on the road, who hopefully hasn't just seen \"The Fast & the Furious\". Waiting for them to arrive safely home is the new ritual.  This is the time to give that cel phone as a gift. No excuse for being late!! Girlfriends are also a big factor here, and these also affect not only the raging hormones but the attitude factor. Luckily, we have been very fortunate in this area. ( the girlfriend part, not the attitude. We have attitude to spare!)  Our son has a girlfriend that we totally love to pieces. Amanda's a sweetie. Other parents aren't as lucky. I've heard the stories. Before ya know it, you're on to Senior year.......senior photos, class ring, (get out the Platinum card...don't put away yet), Prom, after Prom, graduation, graduation party, graduation gift, school tuition, prozac, alchohol & rehab. The last three items are for us parents. Platinum card just upped your limit!!! They  love you man !!  So here we are again, back at 19.  We're very fortunate, our son Nick is a great guy. An honest kid, doesn't party, has nice friends, and really hasn't given us much trouble along the journey  from diapers to adulthood. So a big Happy 19th Birthday Nick!  Enjoy every moment of your special day. All our love to you always....but you know that. And hey, let's try to slow thing down a bit, okay? Sheesh!!  *hugs*\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>02,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Hey there!   Glad i finally got a moment to check out the neighbors... I too saw the stealths......but didnt know what i was watching until now.. now i know i was aposta be scared. I was a ways from them but they were really attention getters.....nothing so stealth about them at night.  I am down in the dumps and tried to stay away from human kind as of late. Feeling a bit better  so  you just may see me for coffee and pie yet. Work has been odd... there is a native there that came to me the other day and wanted to know what  was going on. She said she felt they were all out to get me.. that she could see the trap being laid. I have felt it for a week now.. I just am unsure of the reason behind it. My pay was short $150.......so now do i go and complain on top of all thats going on? Shit ....... i need me a sugar daddy that likes me. Oh well off to work again in the morn so nitey nite.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>02,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      My nerves are frazzled. I have a $10,000.00 deal pending at work. Needless to say, this would really be a big boost to my sales this month....and deals like this come along once in a blue moon. Problem is my customer is a rich, nose in the air, undecisive asshole who keeps playing phone-tag games with me. God if this all comes together, I'll be one happy chicka indeed! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>02,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Other than working till 10PM, today should be a good day at work. This is the wonderful time each month that we not only get our pay check, but our comission check as well. That is if you've been good, and sold enuff to please the \"retail gods\" as it were. The \"gods\" should be reasonable happy with me this month....though not elated. Basically, October sucked sales wise, and we had to scratch and claw for every freakin dollar. Hmf. Well, it's off to the \"Grind\" I go to mix and mingle with the dysfunctional mass I call co-workers. Later!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Sighting of Stealths slows interstate traffic  Interesting little story. Hubbs gets in from his long day on the road, and tells me that while he was traveling on interstate 79 this evening, (just after dusk), he noticed some lights in the sky that he thought were tower lights. Now, he found this quite unusual, as there are no towers in this area. (he's a private pilot, so he knows his tower locations around here). Upon further inspection, the lights turned out to be the lights on the undersides of 2  Stealth Bombers , flying slowly at around 1,ooo feet or so! He flipped out! He said he almost slammed on his brakes to watch, (not a cool thing to do on an interstate!) Everyone else on the road  was slowing  to catch a glimpse too. \"They were  huge \", he said. When I asked him why they'd be around here, flying so low and slow, he said that there was an airplane flying around the Beaver Nuclear Power Plant yesterday , and that it disappeared. Radar couldn't track where it went. So they must be on patrol in the area.  Hubbs then went on to tell me that you're not allowed to fly within a 10 mile radius of a nuclear power plant. Scary stuff. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I must say that I was a bit disappointed by the  urlLink Ghost Cams  I checked out  last night. Hey, I figured Halloween night, full moon, midnight....lots of ghosts on the move right? Not. At least if they were, it wasn't where or when I was looking. Just thought it would be cool to see a spectre on Halloween. Okay, so I don't get out much. Sue me.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,November,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, another Halloween has come and gone, and I must say I was a bit disappointed, though not surprised, with the low count of kids out Trick or Treating last night. I even went out yesterday and bought extra candy (wishful thinking), so that I wouldn't run out. Lemme tell ya, not only didn't I run out......but I now have enuff candy to last me thru 2003. Really. I don't know if it's a good thing or not that I buy the candy that I love. If I'm not a diabetic now....I will be in about 6 months, as there's enuff sugar in that big bag of candy to send a dinosaur into shock! (Guess I'll have to pace myself, eh?) It was a beautiful night to be out, and the full moon was just gorgeous.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>31,December,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Even though we still have 25 minutes to go (here in the East anyway)..............I want to wish everyone a very  Happy, Healthy New year!

In fact it didn't start at all....my car that is. I got in, turned the key, and.........nothing, nada, silence. Damn. So I went inside and asked if any of my co-workers had cables and one of the guys did, so he came out to help me. Well, while he was hooking up the jumpers, I noticed that if he wiggled the left cable, my lights flickered on, then off. He figured out that it wasn't a dead battery, *phew*, but a loose terminal wire. So he tightened it for me, I thanked him, and I was on my way. Thank-you Jeff!    I picked up a few things for our Christmas dinner at Wal Mart, (and a set of cables for my car!!), and I was on my way home. I baked a few dozen cookies and finished wrapping our gifts, then gave Nick a hair cut and well....here I am. Gonna shower and hit the sheets in a bit, as I have to work tomorrow, but luckily not till 1.     Earlier tonight, Hubbs kept asking me, \"Now what was it you wanted for Christmas\"? I really hope this man is kidding with me. Either that, or he's a bloomin' fruitcake. What is it with guys and this last minute shit? Oh well, I'm sure as hell not gonna try to figure that one out. He better be playin' games here. If he isn't, then he can stand in line tomorrow with all his male counterparts, who think that shopping at the last minute and getting all the crumpled left-overs is a way cool ritual of some sort. \"High five\" guys.....shop on. Sheesh. Peace.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>18,December,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Shit, I gotta go back to work tomorrow to rest my weary bones. These past three days off have just about worn me out!  I've done laundry, wrapped dozens of gifts, detailed the interior of my new ride, scrubbed the carpets in the Jeepster, ran the sweeper in the house,  ran the sweeper in the Jeepster, rode down to the 'Burgh with Hubbs to pick up his car, drove back home,  picked up a few last minute gifts, ironed clothes, did my nails for work........well, you get the picture. Freakin' busy. Never did get to the cookies. That happens on Friday after work. One thing that did help  elievate  my stress, was my sis-in-law ok'd us visiting with them on Christmas eve day instead of Christmas. This frees us up to come home on X-mas eve, and enjopy a nice lazy holiday at home.......before back to the \"shit pit\" on Wednesday. Jr. is all happy too.... now he can see  Amanda on Christmas Day. Yeah...everyone is happy!! Now on to the pit tomorrow........ugh. And to all a goodnight!

It's a pretty champagne color, with lots of chrome and a very luxurious interior. She has a few minor dings on her, but hey, she's 11 years old!  I have a few dings on me too....you're gonna get \"dings\" if you're doin' life right!  Right out in front and center. So I cleaned her up a bit today, and took my things out of the Jeep, and put them into my new baby. Now it feels like mine. I went out last night and bought some new mats for the front and a neat plate for the front bumper that says \"Here comes trouble\". Need I say more? Nah. Anyway, I think my new ride and I are gonna have a good time together. Snow will be the real test though. Should be fine with front wheel drive. All the cars I've had before with front wheel drive, just plowed through the snow with no problem. Hubbs and I have to drive down to the 'Burgh in the morning............he's picking up his car, and going on to do his work, and I'm heading back home to do Christmas stuff. Wrapping, baking, etc. I only have today and tomorrow to finish up, but as always, it gets done! Well, gotta hit the sheets.....have to be up early, ugh!

Now all I have to do is wrap them, pick up a few small odds and ends, and voila',  Mother Christmas is done. (I call myself Mother Christmas. Like Mother Nature...If I don't make it happen, it ain't happenin', dig?)    Well, all except for a bit of baking I still have yet to do, but nothing major there.

I ended up with 20 pieces of awesome jewelry. I spent $20.00, but the regular retail added up to over $400.00!! Man deals like this make me too friggin' giddy! Indeed. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>07,December,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I am technologically frustrated tonight. Ya see, I'm a creative person. Give me a sketch pad and a pen, and I'll zip off a drawing in a heartbeat. Hand me a tablet and a pencil, and I'll write you a poem. Show me a house and I'll decorate it to the nines. But let me try to put together a web page, and I'm lost in cyber hell!  God, must it be so freakin' complicated??!  I wanna put some graphics on this blog page, but I don't have a place to store my graphics. When I do get a site for them, I can't figure out how to get them here. I have a site that I can't ftp my blog page to, and I have a site that I can ftp to, but I can't figure that shit out either!!  Damn it. Now I'm not a stupid person, but trying to figure this shit out is like a damn rubics cube for me. I make a bit of headway in one area, only to be screwed in another. What anal, monkey minded, dip shit invented all this complicated bullshit? Now I know there are people out there who are gonna say, \" It's really not all that hard\", yada, yada, yada. Bite me.  When you're trying to figure this all out yourself, with little or no background in this shit....it is hard. I know there gotta be others like me..............the cyber fucked. We're the ones with the pages with errors out the ass, and shit going on that we don't even remember doing. Our pages are bland, cause we can't figure out how to access the hundred freakin graphics we have. Yeah we have em, you just can't see em. God I'm pissed here.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,December,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       I'll have a non-platinum Christmas without you......... I miss my credit cards. *sigh* I've been credit card free for about 6 months now, and it's not been that bad up untill now. This is the time of year when I really had a field day with the old plastic, and getting used to a \"cash only\" Christmas is a bit hard to adapt to. But I'm doing it. *another sigh* See before, if I saw it and wanted it, I got it. Now, I really have to make sure I have the moolah for it, which kinda puts a small damper on my spending spree. Gotta fit into the budget. *rolls eyes* I hate the word budget............so restricting, considering I'm not filthy rich. But I gotta do this for my own good. Being debt free does feel good, I must admit, but this time of year is a real test for me. I feel like a recovering alchoholic sitting at  Frat party.  Just Pepsi for me. *sigh*\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,December,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Totally crazy day at the \"grind\".

It's a gold 1990 New Yorker......hubby says it's a pretty car. I can't wait to get it!  I'll miss my Jeepster though......she got me through many rough winters, and has been a very reliable ride for the past 5 years. Oh well, gotta move on. Hubbs asked me what I want for Christmas, and I said I'd love a remote starter for the car. I hate getting out of work late, and having to trudge through the snow to start my vehicle. And around my house, my car is always the one parked out in the weather, as I get home after everyone else does, so I get the suck-ass parking spot. I  need  this remote starter..... bad !  I should get it, as I've been  very good  this year!!  Like a fine wine, I get better with age................whooo!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,December,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      well talked to my supervisor today about the incident..he all but called me stupid.

I feel like I'm down in the South somewhere. I have the decorating pretty much wrapped up, some shopping done, and I'll be writing out the cards this weekend. But something is amiss without the snow. I dunno, just feels strange to me without it. And it's not just the lack of snow. It's friggin' too warm out for this time of year! The good thing is, that at least this year, I got the lights put up without a blizzard swirling around me, and my neighbors watching from their windows in amusment as I cursed the tangled wires and burned out bulbs, and stapled my glove to the window sill. Ah, fond memories indeed. Anyway, things are rolling around pretty well in holiday prep land. Now, all I need is a sprinkling of snow and some major hints from a few people on  my gift list. Fa la la la la la la la la!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,December,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Today has been a day much like the rest. The rat race is in full swing and i believe i have cheese in my pockets. Everyone is after me. To be alone for ten minutes was all i wanted. On the ride home i stop in a parking lot and shut down for ten minutes.. damn thats sad when you cant find a quiet corner to call your own. Feel sorry for me yet? I think i can still be adopted... one800lifesucks. $1.95 per minute. Girls gotta eat you know? just wanted to post something.. nothing really going on in my life .. playing phone tag with the doctors this week to get results.. think they just want to stress me out so they can doctor me for stress!!! later Krazy\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,December,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Today as I was leaving work, I told the woman that drove on the \"ride from hell\" yesterday, that I was getting her a Guardian Angel visor clip to protect her when she drives. She turns to me and says, \"Why that's so thoughtful of you, you're always so sweet\". Shit, she really thinks she's a good driver. Either that, or my smart-ass skills need honing.  Hmmmmmm. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>03,December,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Note to self: never, ever, never ever, ride with any co-workers, to any meetings, anywhere, ever.  Period . Today was the  second  time that I had near death experiences while riding with a co-worker to an out-of-state meeting. Two times, two crazy ass freakin' drivers. Not good crazy.... suck ass, nail biting, feet pressed to the floor board, praying to God crazy !  I should have known I was in trouble when we got into the car, and she drove with her chest against the wheel. We merged onto the interstate (merging is a whole nuther story), and thats where it all goes awry. Speed limit in the highway is 65, so most are  driving around 70 or so. Well not us. We Couldn't just maintain one speed. Hell no....we like variety here, so lets just try out all the speeds. In fact, we'll alternate like every 20 seconds or so. So lets go 55, then up to 70, drop down to 50 for a bit, then speed up to 65 only to drop down to 55 cause a truck ahead of us is creeping along. Now we could pass him, as there's no one in the passing lane. For miles. But no, we'll follow him for a bit. Just chat and enjoy the scenery. Then we get a brain-storm like, \"Oh yeah, we do have to be at that meeting by Noon, huh?, hit the gas, and launch ahead like freakin' rocket. Well this went on for a 'bout an hour and a half or so. Anyway to make a long story short, we took a wrong exit and had to loop around again, then we got into a funeral procession going 20 mph, and  finally  ended up at the meeting on time. Amen, I'm still alive at this point.  See prayer does work!! On the ride back, just do everything in reverse, but no funeral procession. Needless to say, I was ecstatic to get back to my Jeep and drive again. I can't believe these folks make it anywhere alive. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>03,December,2001</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I'm having a bland day today. I hate these kinda days...not happy, not sad.........somewhere in between. Bland. \"Bland Land\". I think I just have too much going on in the ole cranium, and rather than go nuts, I've gone to \"Bland-Land\". That has to be it. A survival skill, that enables one to cruise along and not inflict bodily harm on those in the general vicinity, that are in an overly goofy, Three Stooges kinda mood today. And in my face about it. So better to be bland, than be incarcerated. I hope my \"stooge\" realizes that he was spared because of the blandness.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Sorry 'bout the lack of posts over the past couple of days, but between trying to get a new web page up and running, and a bad case of PMS, I either didn't have time to get here or I just didn't give a rats ass. Nothing exciting going on here anyway. Well, I really shouldn't say that........Hubbs did get my car running properly yesterday. That made me very happy indeed. Hopefully, the days of \"hot wiring\" it to get it started are over!  And I did get all the Christmas decor put away on Wednesday. But it's been down-hill ever since. There's so much I want to do, but I'm just not in the mood, and it's getting me frazzled! I really thought I was gonna get alot of tasks done while I was on vacation, but for some reason, that plan has hit the skids. Enter mental confusion.  I guess the only thing to do is just roll with it, and cruise along. Go with the flow.  I think I have a big load up in the ole cranium, and that's about all it wants to handle right now. Some of my current mental stirrings are: an aging dog (my baby girl)  that I have to make a decision on wether to put her to sleep or not, aging parents (Mom hasn't been well, and they live far away), a job that is stressing me out more every day, and a few other biggies I don't feel like getting into. Maybe a good nights sleep will help me to see matters in a clearer light. Hopefully calmer too. And in the mean time, let the dust-bunnies run amuck!! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>23,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Pinch me. I must be dreaming.

Ahhhhhhhhhh....pure bliss! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>18,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      You know, I just love my new car, but lately it's driving me buggy with starting problems. Problem is.........it doesn't want to start. Well, when  it  wants to start it does. Unfortunately, this usually doesn't coincide with when  I  want it to start. There you have it. Just call my car \"Christine\". For those of you that might not have seen the movie, it's about a posessed car named Christine. Now, I have asked three different guys what the problem is, and I got three different answers. And you wonder why I want to learn about auto mechanics. Nuff said. I guess I'll just have to wait till Hubbs takes a look at it, and we decide what needs to be done to remedy this annoying situation. The sooner the better. Right now, she's being cooperative....even allowing the remote starter to do it's thing. Tomorrow morning.........who knows. Guess we'll have to see what mood \"Christine\" is in when it's time to leave for work.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>17,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I just got done shoveling the snow from my driveway. You have no idea what a  miracle  this is. I haven't shoveled snow in friggin' years, but since Hubbs is driving home tonight instead of tomorrow, I wanted him to be able to get in the drive safely. Especially since he's not going to be here till after 2 a.m.. Anyway, I survived the shoveling without a heartattack. (Refer back to Wednesday....\"survived walk without heartattack\"). Hey, this shit happens. So yeah, Hubbs is heading North as I type. I left him a voice-mail this morning about the snowstorm that was gonna move in tomorrow, and that maybe he should get his butt in gear and haul it on home early. He is. I'm glad. I won't be happy 'till I know he's in the house and safe though. Work today just makes me long for my upcoming weeks vacation even more. The idiots were prime today..........I just kept to myself. Tomorrow is gonna be a bitch....Saturdays always are, with both teams working 4 hours together..... retail bedlam at it's finest! Then we found out today, that on Monday and Tuesday we're having some kinda January clearance sale, and we're working 10 to 10. Surprise! Holy MacShit Ronald! The only thing that's gonna motivate me through those two days, is knowing that I'll be off the whole following week. Amen!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>17,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      What an evening! My trip to \"The Bug\" was enjoyable.I came out with a silver chain belt, a black beaded necklace, a silver necklace with red enamel lips in the middle and two great tops..........all at 30% off the clearance prices! Retail \"high five\"!!  then I went over to the dollar Tree and picked up a few odds and ends. when I got home, tricia was standing at my door with a huge beautifully wrapped box, and a big grin on her face. Scared the shit out of me at first, cause there usually isn't someone standing in the dark at my door at 9 in the evening.  I invited her in, and I unwrapped my \"belated birthday gift\"..............a great pasta gift set, and a bottle of raspberry cologn spritz with little fairies on the cap. What a nice, and thoughtful surprise! Thanx darlin'! *smiles* She stayed for coffee, and we gabbed a bit about work and all kinds of stuff. It was nice. We don't see eachother as much as we'd like, but when we do get together it's like no time has passed at all. If you look up the meaning of true friend, all it needs to say is Tricia. Nuff said.                  Amanda stopped over later in the evening, and gave me a big hug. *smiles again* What a sweetie pie she is! She ordered pizza and wings for all of us, which was really a sweet thing to do. Needless to say they were yummy! Thanks for the goodies Manda.....my treat for that lunch we've been talking about!  Ole'!  Well, I gotta hit the sheets......my eyes are blurry and that usually my signal to go to bed. Nite all!! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>16,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      They called me from the car audio place, and said that my car was ready. Woohoo! Well, my son didn't get out of work for another hour, so I decided to hoof it down to the shop. Now realize that the shop is only about a mile or so from my house, but the fact that it it very cold out and I haven't done any serious \"hoofing it\" in a long time mad it a bit of a challenge for me. Like, since I smoke, will I have a friggin' heart attack on the way over, and be left in the ditch for days, or at least untill the snow melts? Could happen.  So to cover myself, I called my son and left a message in his voice-mail, to search the ditches along the road if I wasn't home by 6. Good plan huh? I thought so. Needless to say, I arrived there in one (frozen) piece, and AJ showed me how to use the remote to start my car, etc. I nodded, and said \"uh huh\" a few times, and I was on my way. Ten minutes later, I was calling him saying, \"Uh, what was that little button on the bottom for again\"? He was very patient in answering my questions, but I'm sure as hell he was thinking \"dumbass\". Oh well. I'm not a  dumbass, but my memory is shot to hell. I think it happened in the 70's or there abouts. Dunno. I can't remember. See. Happened again! Tonight I'm gonna head up to Fashion Bug for a bit, do a bit of \"browsing\", so I'll get to give it a road test. I'm glad I didn't get a car alarm. Man, you screw up on those things, everyone within a 20 mile radius knows you're a dweeb-o. And even if someone was stealing your car, no one would notice. They would just think it was someone with a new alarm, look over, grin, and go right back to doing whatever. Well, off to make dinner, then spend a bit of time at \"The Bug\". Browsing, Yeah. *wink wink*\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>13,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I ordered another book to help me with my upcoming 'Vette purchase. The other book I ordered from Corvette Central just didn't have the info I needed. It's going back. So anyway, I called to order  urlLink \"Secrets to buying a used Corvette\" , and my order was taken by the author himself, Bill Gall. Nice guy.......and he  really  knows his stuff! I asked him if he'd sign my book for me, and he said \"No problem.....but I don't think it's gonna add any value to the book\"! Lol! Should have it by next week. I can't wait! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>13,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I'm off work today and doin' nuthin'. Life is good, I'll tell ya! And as I type this, I'm listening to music I downloaded to burn onto a CD later. This is a  miracle  to me. Where was all this cool shit when I was growing up?? Hell, if you wanted music you had to  buy  it, and then you had to get the whole cassette to get that one song you loved. Oh this downloading stuff is way too cool! I'm gonna be making CD's like there's no tomorrow. Oh yeah. My own life sountrack! Now I just have to wait till my son shows me how to burn 'em.......always a catch. My guys always go on a power trip when it comes to showing me how to do things on my computer. Thats okay, I just tell 'em I'll wait. No hurry. I know they would love me to pester them, like the info they have is  so  valuable to me that I just have to have it now. Not! I'll wait. Ha Ha. I went without this shit for 44 years, one more day doesn't mean squat to me.          I took my car to the Audio Shop this morning to have the remote starter installed. It will be  so  nice to start the damn thing without trudging out in the snow in the morning or after work. One of the guys at work was ribbing me as to why I need a remote starter. After giving him my reasons, he was still giving me a hard time about it, so I just said \"Cause I want one, thats why, so shut the hell up about it already\". He shut up. It's pityful how easy it is to shut these guys down. Throw 'em a bit of attitude and they back right off. Wimps. No challenge whatsoever. Gotta love my Hubby. He always gives me a run for my money! Love it!!             I'm not doing shit today............just relaxing and watching the day float by. Hubbs is in North Carolina with his brother for 5 days on a golf trip....so I'm goofing off for a couple of days! I've turned my back on the dust bunnies and laundry. I strolled by the un-made beds.....no problem!  Now tomorrow, I'll be in the groove again. I can only stand this shit around me for one day, then I gotta dig in. Don't wanna go into it now though..........today is for goofing off!  Like I said before........life is good!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>13,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Born to be Wild Another lovely day off today.........God I love these days off. I need to find a job I love, not just one that pays the bills. Anyway, I think Hubbs and I are going to take a ride down to Corvette City today and walk the lot, just to see what they have out there. Spring is just around the corner and I wanna have plenty of cruisin time with my new baby this year. I got my car back on thursday and the tranny shifts like a dream now. Amen! I am soooo friggin' happy to have my own car back, you have no idea. The mechanic that did my tranny was nice enuff to bring it home for me, so I rode him back to his house. We were talking cars and stuff, and he said \"I gotta show you what I have in my garage\". Hmmmmm.....got my curiousity peaked??? So we pull in the drive, open the garage door, and there he has a Buick Grand National! Beautiful car, and  fast as hell  right from the factory. God it was a sight. I looked in the door and I saw a NOS sticker on the dash. \"Hey, you run nitrous in this..no wonder it's as fast as you say\", I told him. \"Never used it\" he said. \"I'll bring it over in the summer and let you have it for a weeked....go cruise around a bit\". \"Are you nuts\", I said in shock!!?? \"Nah, No problem\" he said kinda matter of fact like. I can't wait. Well, there it is. I'm becoming a \"gear head\" again, just like I was 25 years ago. Most women in their 40's have a career and take up hobbies like gardening, or painting or something. Not me, nah, I gotta take up auto mechanics and driving \"Muscle Cars\". And no this isn't some kind of \"Mid-Life Crisis' bullshit. I just miss the grease under my nails and the excitement of a rumbling engine under the hood.........and this time it's gonna be mine all mine. And that makes it even sweeter.  Those that know me well, will just shake their heads and grin. Doesn't surprise 'em a bit.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well now this has been a special week for me. Monday was a Monday what can you say about that? Tuesday I had surgery. My son dropped me off.. then was late picking me up from it. Figures.. never count on your kids to be on time. After a brief nap I did the dishes and homework with son then went to bed for the nite. Wednesday I returned to work but by Wednesday nite the doc had me go to the emergency room as my lips are still numb from the gas they gave me. They rechecked me and said i just have what would be equivalent to a boxers lip. Like i got punched when i was under general. What the hell do they do to you when your sleeping like that? The inside of my lips were cut through by my teeth where they pressed the mask down on me so as a precaution they RX something so they dont get infected. Then to top of this... the emergency room had the balls to charge me.. and they are the ones that did this to me. They said the feeling should come back in a few days to see my reg. doc on friday.. another charge if i had done it.  By the next day i was on the phone and the big bosses at the hospital said they would make accomidations for me.. I have not heard another thing from them since thursday. Friday comes and i am still numb.. still working though.. trying to help out my Gateway Bosses.. so ok i go in still numb mouthed and am told that Gateway is closing all their remote sites.. I will be out of work as of March 3rd. So keep your eyes and ears open Krazy.. i be needin a job right quick. I have not told the other half yet. I dont want to see him happy yet. So now to end the week.. its Saturday nite and my mouth is still numb....and the hospital still has not called. Wonder just what they are planning to accomidate.........A new job would be nice. Something without sick people though.. i am not into sick!!!!  Well enough about my wonderful life.....hows yours going?\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Boy I am soooo glad that I don't start work till 2:30 tomorrow. Almost like having another day off. In fact when I go in tomorrow, I plan on turning in a couple of vacation days for the end of the month........all total I'll have a whole week off, (combining my 2 vacation days with my schedualed days off, equals 7 days total) Nice! Then, I still have 3 more to use before the end of June, when I get two weeks again. This past year, I managed to turn two weeks vacation into 4...thanks to the bosses allowing us to split up the days. See, they're only assholes 95% of the time. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>09,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I ordered my first Corvette buyers guide online yesterday from  urlLink Corvette Central . It should arrive next week, and I can begin learning about what to look for in a good used Vette. I also bought a copy of Corvette and Chevy Trader magazine just to take a peek at whats out there, and what they are selling for. I want to get one with a 454 in it, but they aren't as easy to find as the 350's. Finding this \"scream machine\" may take a bit of effort, but hell yeah it's going to be so worth it!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>09,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, I have some good news on the car scene. My New Yorker has been in the shop since Tuesday and Hubbs said that it will be done today. Great huh? Hell yeah....I want my ride back. Shit, I hardly had a chance to drive it, before it ended up in the shop for repairs. We didn't even have a chance to bond yet!!  At least now I know the tranny will be good to go for a long time. Hubbs let me take his car to work for two days, but I was a nervous wreck the whole time, 'cause he is very picky about how his car is driven. Can't say that I blame him, as his job requires him to do extensive driving. Anyway, I was a wreck the whole time I drove the damn thing. Then there's my sons truck. I drove that thing to work on  Monday, and talk about being nervous. That truck makes so many freakin' strange grinding noises, that I thought for sure I had ruined something, somewhere. Here he tells me, after I get home, that it does that shit all the time. Couldn't have told me about the things little neuroses before I left, huh? Nah. I can't wait to have my car back. Now you would think that this would be an easy task to accomplish. Well, probably in someone elses life it would be. But not in my dysfunctional little corner of the world. See, my son is off work tomorrow, so I ask him if he would ride me to get my car. Hell no...today is the one year anniversary of his auto accident. He's not leaving the house today.  So now I can't get my car today due to intense superstition. Only in my world I'll tell ya. I'll bet cha if it was his ride, we'd be out there picking it up  at the friggin' butt crack of dawn!  I'm getting pretty frustrated with the testosterone crowd in this place. 'Nuff said.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>09,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I'm so tired of cleaning my house on my days off. Just once, I'd love to have the house clean when I get home. I'd like to spend a day off, enjoying a clean house for a change. Aint gonna happen. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Ah.... the pure bliss of vehicle ownership!  Not!  Seems my latest ride has developed some tranny problems, so I'm currently taking turns driving the guys vehicles. This is a royal pain in the ass.....for all of us. And it's gonna get even more frustrating on the days we all work.....I'll just have to drive mine and pray that I don't get stuck stranded on the road somewhere. The real problem lies in how I'm gonna get to work while the tranny is being re-built. Shit. I guess we'll figure it all out somehow.  Speaking of vehicles...only a couple more months 'till I get to shop for my \"Vette\". Now we're talkin' bliss! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>05,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Another Year Older........Oh Yeah!!!  I must say I had a very nice birthday today. I switched shifts with a co-worker, so I was able to get out at 5 instead of 9.....nice! This afternoon, Joy and Ron hustled me off to a new Mexican restaurant near work, for a surprise b-day lunch!! It was yummy, and we all left very full...not only full of food....but gas as well!!! Lol! I thought that was such a sweet thing to do. Then I got home, and my \"guys\" sang \"Happy Birthday\" to me when I came in the door, and was greeted by a huge bunch of purple balloons, a cheesecake and a pretty gift bag!!! Wow......!!!  *Big smiles*  They got me a digital camera and a purple sports watch!  I was blown away, as I never expected the camera. I told Hubbs that I was gonna get myself one later in the year......so I  never  thought that he'd get me one today. I had given him a few small things on my wish list, and I really thought that's what I'd find in the bag. What a  sweetheart  he is! Indeed! If he installs the software for me tomorrow while I'm at work, I'll be putting photos on my web page in no time.This is gonna be fun! Hubbs also made a yummy spaghetti dinner, so I was able to take a little \"nappy\" after work. My brother and my folks called me this evening, and just hearing their voices is a wonderful gift in itself. And Amanda, the big hugs you gave me tonight are  priceless . Thank you. *smiles* A huge \"Thank You\" to everyone that made my birthday a day that I'll always remembar with joy in my heart. I am blessed to have such beautiful souls sharing this lifetime with me. I love you all. *Hugs* \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,January,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Hey there.. just thought i would drop a note to the internet ghost so that they will smile down kindly on me.

Oh well......yummies for later on today! I  love  New Years Day. Everything suddenly seems fresh, a new beginning. Not that this does me any good six months from now, but I always start the year with good intentions. I have learned one thing though.....I will not try to write a journal this year. I must have at least 6 of 'em started, (yeah, on New Years Day) that I never finish. Not gonna make that mistake this year. Well, I better hit the sheets.......gotta wok in the morning, and as it is, I'm going to be dragging my ass big time. I'll post more about our evening tomorrow. Oh, and a few of my resolutions too. You know.....the ones I never keep!!  Kidding....I  try . Peace in 2002. Nite.   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>27,February,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Thank goodness I'm finally starting to feel like myself again! The past two weeks have been pure hell on the work front, therefore the lack of posts here. first off, one of my co-workers was on vacation for 12 days and another ended up in the hospital for major surgery, leaving only three of us working for over a week. Not only did this mean endless running after customers, but no dinner hours and very few bathroom breaks to boot. It's tiring as  hell with 5 of us on the floor, but with three.......well it stretched us to our limits. Then last week I found out I lost a big sale due to an error made by one of the girls in the office. When I spoke to the ball-less asshole we loosely call our manager, he basically told me tuff beans, these things happen, get over it. And he really didn't give a shit about my customer, or the fact that she was rightfully upset about the whole ordeal.  Well, it literally made me ill to know that even though I can write a sale perfectly, I can lose it all at any time, and there are no resources to back me up. I cried, I was so upset. Not only did I lose money, but a current customer and a future one as well, as she was going to buy more things from me in the future.  I don't need this shit. I had to come home from work on Monday because I was feeling lousy, like I had the flu or something, but I truely believe that part of the reason I felt the way I did was due to the stress I felt from the lost sale incident. Well hopefully I won't have to deal with this bullshit much longer. Soooooooo...... my best  friend and I have been saying for a long time, that we should be in business together, and we came up with a  brilliant  idea the other day. And guess what? We're gonna persue it. Hell ya! Can't say much about it yet, as we don't believe there is anything out there like it, and we don't want anyone beating us to the punch. So till we have everything wrapped up legally, mums the word. Exciting indeed!  Turning lemons into lemonade we are!! Yup, yup!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>24,February,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Happy 20th birthday Amanda!   Why don't you drop in at www.munkysayblar.com and wish a sweet young lady, a very Happy 20th birthday? I'm sure she'd  love  it!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>20,February,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Ok, so I haven't posted in 10 days. Bite me. Sometimes real life happens while you're blogging. And although I do love sitting down and writing here, at times I just like to turn the ole brain off completely, and just veg out. No thoughts, no typing, nuthin' my friend. Brain silence. And then again, at times I just don't wanna replay my whole freakin' day again......it sucked the first time around, and the last thing I want to do is re-hash the whole damn thing all over again. Get it? Got it.     I think I'm kinda in a blog boredom phase here lately. (see I go through alot of phases. I'm kinda like the moon!) Anyway, even reading them lately has become a bore for me. They're all basically the same, in one manner or another. Just different layouts and graphics, opinions and links, photos and comments. After awhile though, they all blurr together in a whirl of html code and bullshit.  Like a big \"journalist- wannabe\" garbage disposal. Boring. This is boring.  I'm done venting. Nuff said.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,February,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Once again, I've stayed up waaay too late, in a desperate effort to prolong my days off. Problem is, I'll sleep in late today, and probably drag my ass all afternoon. Hmmmmmm........actually, that doesn't sound like a bad idea. I was gonna bitch about wasting half the day, and yada, yada, but forget it. Dragging my lazy ass around, on a lazy Sunday afternoon sounds okey-dokey to me!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>09,February,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Personally, I'm not much of an Olympics fanatic. I do enjoy the figure skating and the skiing, but I'm not gonna break into a sweat if I miss the stuff either. What I do want to say, is that the opening ceremonies are just awe inspiring, to say the least. I can't even imagine, in my wildest dreams, the planning and work that is involved in pulling off a spectacle of that magnitude. It was utterly magnificent! Bravo!  I'm done. I've used up all my big words for the day. Nite!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>05,February,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I've been feeling helpless lately, and being a Capricorn, I don't do helpless well at all. See, we like to be in control of the situation at all times, and if & when we can't, it's a frustrating thing to us. I'm frustrated. See, my best friend is going through some really rough, life changing stuiff right now, and all I can do is offer support, and let her know that I'm there for her. She says it's enuff, I don't feel it is. I want to make everything okay, make the light at the end of the tunnel appear brighter....and closer.  She's as strong as steel, but right now she doesn't feel it. I want to make her feel strong. We've been on alot of \"journeys\" together, but this is a big one. And yeah, I'm there for the long haul, but I wish I could do more. More than just a phone call or visit. I want to snap my fingers and make things right, for this wonderful lady that only deserves the best that life has to offer. And the best will be hers....after the dust settles and the smoke clears. But trudging through the dust and smoke is a bitch, and sometimes because of the debris, you can't see the rainbow thats at the end of it all. I want to lead her to the rainbow. I know that we all have our own journeys to travel, and knowing that we have people that love us in our corner helps to carry us through. Been there. But I so wish there was more I could do. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,February,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Wow did we get some major snow today! Normally, this would not even turn our heads here, but this winter has been so mild that when we do get dumped on we're like \"what the hell\"! My guys dug out the driveway, and cleaned off all our vehicles, so we're business as usual again. I cleaned the carpets today.......whoooohoooo! Damn were they bad! It feels so goods to have them smelling and looking clean again. I'll tell ya, when dogs get old, they stink to high heaven if you don't bathe them, like every other day. Ugh. Well, with the major cleaning job out of the way, tomorrow I chill. Cruise. Veg. Whatever you wanna call it. I'm so there. I've been working on my Klutter2 site for quite awhile now, and though it isn't as  fancy as alot of sites out there, I'm pretty happy with it. I'm sure I'll be changing it and updating it dozens of times before I'm really satisfied! Keeps me out of trouble, eh?  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>02,February,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Nuthin' much new here in La La Land....pretty much the same ole stuff.  Went back to work on Wednesday, and I gotta tell ya, it still sucks there. I thought that maybe after a week off, my perspective would change about the whole place. Nah, it still friggin' sucks. In fact, after some time off, it's even  more  noticable to me. I'm already trying to figure out when my next week off will be. Can you tell that my sanity revolves around the days I don't work? We all got called into the \"wardens\" office today, and got either write-ups or verbal warnings regarding our sales and warranty  figures.  My last warning was a  year  ago, in January, and the asshole asks me what the problem is and if there's any training he can offer me?  Shit, I had  one  low month in a friggin' year, and you're gonna make a big ass deal out of it? Get the hell away from me before I rip your head off! The pressure there is unreal. According to the \"wardens\", we sales people do no right, and are the root of all evil at the store. If it wasn't for the sales teams, they wouldn't have jobs. Assholes. Man I can't wait to start another day tomorrow!      \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>29,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      It is a positively gorgeous day today! I was gonna clean my room today, but the sunshine is calling me outside................to wash my car. I haven't had a good day to clean it up since I got it in November, so today's the day. Tonight I have to get all the Easter goodies wrapped up. I don't know if we're leaving tomorrow nite or Sunday. Either way, I need to get everything together. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>28,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I would love to change my first name. I've thought about this for a long time now, and even though it would be a pain in the ass to change documents, credit cards, etc. it would be cool to have a first name that I really love and I got to pick. I always keep an ear open for unusual names. A couple I've heard recently, and really like are Rocque, (pronounced \"rocky\"), and Micha, (like mica). What do you think? Did you ever want another first name? If so, what would it be? Hmmmmm. Interesting. Let me know!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>27,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Today went just as I planned it. My dentist visit was a breeze. I got a good cleaning, and he filled three little cavities along my front top teeth. Then I buzzed home and started on the guest room. I cleared everything out of there, and I must say it looks wonderful. Although I realized, we really do need to get a new mattress in there. Now that I sell mattresses, I know how crappy ours really is. Ugh. I feel sorry for our guests. I'm going to look at the ones we have at work when I go back, (ugh, don't wanna think about that now!), and see how much a decent one would run me. Just a thought. On the other hand. If I get a bed that's too comfy, they might want to stay longer. Hmmm. Should I get an extra firm?? Just another thought.  Lol! Then I got caught up on all the laundry. It was a very productive day indeed. So tomorrow is gonna be chill-out day for me. I think I deserve it! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I was in vacation mode all day at work today. It was a pretty slow day, and it seemed to drag on forever...... I thought that 9 o'clock would never arrive. But of course it did, and here I am on the eve of a wonderful 7 day \"all my time is mine\" athon. Beautiful. I have a few things I do want to get accomplished around the house, but other than that, I'm gonna  enjoy  my freedom week.         I can't believe Easter is almost here!  It kinda snuck up on me this year. As a matter of fact, I still need to get out and pick up a few more items, and get them wrapped up. Usually I don't have much to take care of, but since we're probably going home to visit, I need to pick up a few extra goodies. Sometimes it seems like the errands  never    end!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Man, I need to get some serious sleep tonight. I tossed and turned  all  damn night last night. It is sooo frustrating when that happens!  I almost dozed off this afternoon at work. Not a good thing to do on the sales floor, but we were very slow today, and that made it very easy to kinda nod off for a sec here and there. No biggie though. I just grabbed anpother cup of coffee and I was good to go untill closing. But now that I'm home and relaxed, it's really starting to hit me. Tomorrow's my last day of work for a whole week. I can't wait to get a bit done around the house, (hopefully outside), and finish up my Easter shopping. Well, I think I better hit the sheets and get rested up for tomorrow. With a bit of luck, and the right attitude, the day will go fast. Nitey night!  Zzzzzzzzzz\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>24,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Wow did I have a case of \"cabin-fever\" last night! I went to bed around 8:45 or so because I was feeling very frustrated, like there was nothing I wanted to do or watch on TV. I just wanted to shut my brain off. Shit I can't wait till all this friggin snow is outta here and I can get outside. I can't take looking at these walls any longer.  (Note to self: you wouldn't last very long in jail. Avoid at all cost.) Duh.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>22,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Nuthin' really new around here today. Most of my excitement happens over on my Shark Attack page! Good news was that I started work late today, so the long morning was really nice. It was snowing like mad when I left this afternoon. It's a  good thing I gave myself a bit of extra time, because I got held up by an accident scene, then farther up the road, all the traffic lights were out at some major intersections. Needless to say, the traffic light problem slowed me up alot. One thing I have to say though, I was really surprised how courteous the drivers were of eachother at the problem lights. Everyone just took turns, which is a miracle if you knew how much traffic there is at these lights!  Anyway, I did get to work on time. I lucked out tonight, too. The weather was really bad around 7:30, so our boss decided to draw cards to see which two of us could leave early. Well, my card wasn't drawn, but Jeffery's was, and he let me go instead. He's such a gentleman, and has done this for me numerous times over the Winter. Thanks alot Jeff! Well, I do have to be up early tomorrow, but I get out at 5 so that's  really  a good thing! Nite all! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>20,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Happy 1st Day of Spring Everyone! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>17,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I'm off work today, and it sure feels good to be at home and do as I please.  Problem is  that I have so much stuff that needs done around here, that my days off involve more work than my work days. Some days, I really think I need to hire a housekeeper to come in once a week, just to keep me on track, so I don't get so bogged down on my days off.  Years ago, I used to clean houses, and those women just loved me I'll tell ya. Now I know why. I have a  long way to go before I could ever let anyone in here to clean for me. Poor woman would have an anurism if she saw all the shit I have cluttering this place right now! Ugh. Well, I guess I've stalled enuff, and should get my butt in gear and just get started! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>17,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Starting today, all my Corvette updates will be posted on my Vette Dreams site (which I originally intended to do, but somehow got side-tracked!)

A  decent  human being spoke to me!  A-friggin-men! This  lovely  woman, Judy, was not only nice to me, but she was  more  than accomodating when I asked her when I could take a look at the car. \"Anytime\", she said, \"just let me know when you'd like to see it\". Wow!  Simple. Easy. No bullshit. I actually found someone who wants to sell their car, and not put me throught he wringer to do it. We're gonna go see it on Wednesday. Needless to say, I can't wait! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>16,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I'm having a real problem lately with people that have their cars for sale. I just don't get it. So far, out of the 4 people I've delt with,  all  of them have been a pain in the ass. First one, \"Fucktard\", wouldn't let me know the car was sold, even after I called him for 5 days, and he had already sold it on the first day. We'll just classify him under \"asshole\".  Second one, \"Mr. Rochester\" misled me by saying the car was in great, ready to drive condition. After a 3 hour drive to Rochester, the only place that \"heap\" was ready to drive to was the salvage yard. Classification: \"dip shit\". Third one, so far hasn't e-mailed me or phoned me with any info what-so-ever. No classification at this time. Fourth one, the \"Market Gal\". I call her today to ask if her car is still for sale from last year, and she gets this attitude like, \"Well I'll have to let you know. I just had it worked on, and I put alot of money into it, soooooooooooo it won't be cheap.\" Did I say I wanted cheap?? I mean either you're selling it or not. If you are, give me the price and lets go from there.  Classification: Bitch. These people are unreal. I just wanna buy a car, plain and simple. I'm not asking for much here, just a bit of courtesy. If your car has sold, take the time to tell me. Send me an e-mail or put a message on the answering machine. No big effort involved there. If I ask what condition your car is in............don't lie. I'll figure out that you're lying when I see the car. And if I call and am interested in your car, don't treat me like I can't afford it. I wouldn't be looking if I couldn't afford the fucking thing. I have cash.........do you want it or not??  So as of right now, I'm still in limbo-land, still looking and calling. I just hope that sooner or later, (I hope sooner), I run into a nice person that will at least return my calls and be honest with me. I don't think that's too much to ask for.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>15,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I had some good news at work today. (Gee, that's a sentence you won't hear very much!) Anyway, the vacation days I put in for were approved, so at the end of this month I'll have a wonderful 7 days off!  The beauty of it is, I only used 2 actual vacation days. I hope the weather is decent, so I can get outside and start some spring cleaning around the yard. I can't wait! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>14,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      It's a rainy Friday night. The kind of night where you just want to take a hot shower, cuddle up on the sofa with a new magazine and relax a bit. I think in awhile I'm gonna do just that. Yeah. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>14,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, today's adventure didn't go exactly as I had hoped................ no car . But don't worry, I didn't have that breakdown, despite the lack of sleep last night. I'll post more about our day tomorrow, as I'm gonna go crash out now. I feel like I'm getting a bug or something. And don't worry, the saga continues.......... I already have a lead on another one!   But before I go off to beddie bye land..........a prayer.  \"Now I lay me down to sleep; we told the clown, his Vette to keep. If it should sell, before I wake;  well some poor fool, made a  big  mistake\"!  Amen.

But quite frankly, I'm way too excited and nervous to sleep. Excited at the prospect that I may be driving home in my dream car tomorrow..................nervous that I won't. I do not do well with shit like this. Not at all. See, I've waited 31 years for this day to arrive. 31 years.  Thirty-one years . Thats a long time to  want  something,  wait  for something,  dream  about something. My dream may be hours away from coming true..........or put on hold. The suspense is gnawing at my gut..........not knowing is driving me nuts here. God help me if this car turns out to be \"the one\". I'll probably have a nervous breakdown right there on the spot, and not even be able to drive home! But hopefully that will be the case. The alternative will make for a long ride home. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>13,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, our plans are made for our trip to New York tomorrow morning. We decided to drive instead of fly, figuring it would be less hassle in the long run. We should get there around noon or so, have some lunch, then start the inspection. With a bit of luck, I'll be driving home a happy, happy woman! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>12,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       urlLink Heres  a pic of the 79 Vette that I'm gonna check out in Rochester tomorrow.

Mike called today, and said that he  could  meet with us on Thursday to show us the car. I can't believe it! I was all prepared to hear the words \"I can't\", when I listened to the message on my machine. But my prayers were answered, and it's a go! I don't know if we're gonna fly or drive, but either way, we're  outta here  on Thursday morning. Now I just hope I'm not disappointed when I inspect the car. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Another hurdle.

This one's in Rochester N.Y. I called the guy this afternoon, and he was very nice. He answered all my questions, and didn't treat me like I was a dumbass. I'm trying to set up a meeting to see the car ASAP, as I'm nervous someone is gonna scoop this one too. I don't know if my nerves can handle all this searching and drama that's involved. Hell, by the time I get my car, I'll have had a nervous breakdown and won't be competent to drive the fucker. Anyway, Hubbs said that he'd fly me up this week, weather permitting, and if Mike's work schedual permits. My driving bliss is fringing on too many factors lately. I don't like it. Anyone got any Valium? \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>09,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Hello Amanda! *hugs*\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>07,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I'm up to my ass in Hamsters.

This is after I called for 5 days. I just chocked it up to experience, and now I'm looking at some others that have potential. I found one in Rochester that I'm gonna call about tomorrow. Hopefully, I wont find \"Fuck-tard #2\" on the other end of the line, eh?\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>07,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Update on \"Vette Quest\": Greg, who we will lovingly refer to as \"fuck-tard\", hasn't returned any of my calls as of yet. Kinda odd for someone who wants to sell a vehicle, and has an interested buyer anxiously waiting to see the car. I just don't get it. I was really upset about it last night, as this ride sounds just like what I'm looking for, and the price is right. Maybe this is an omen or something. Maybe he's just an asshole. He could at least have the courtesy to call me if it's been sold or he's changed his mind. Hubbs says I should let him call, as maybe the guy didn't take me seriously because I'm a woman. Man, that would be this guys first mistake! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,March,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Wow! Long time, no post. Shit has been going down at work that you just wouldn't believe. Hopefully I'll be back on track, as I'm off for the next two days and I can do a bit of catching up.  On a happy note, gonna look at a 74 Vette tonight (if all works out as planned) and I'm really stoked about it! It sounds cherry, but I gotta see it to believe it. Keep your fingers crossed for me, okay? \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,April,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      It's been awhile since I've posted.........I know. See, the problem is, everything that's exciting in my world right now, revolves around \"baby\", my Corvette. And all news pertaining to our adventures are on the Shark Attack page, therefore this page has experienced a \"post-lag\", so to speak. Hmmm, let's see. I had a great sales month in March.......just broke $56,000.00! Believe me, that doesn't happen very often in our store. Maybe a few times a year. Needless to say, I enjoyed the commission at months end. It was nice to get paid up on some bills, and still have a bit left over for fun stuff! Like they say, feast or famin..that's what my job is. I find it totally un-nerving at times.   My uncle Stanley died the other day. It's kinda wierd, because I've only met him once, as he lived in California. He was my Dads younger brother. I feel bad for my Dad, because his brother was so far away, they didn't really have any contact for years, and I know he feels bad about that. When his Mom passed away it was the same senario. Must be really hard to have your whole family live on the other side of the country. I find it hard to be away from my family sometimes, and mine are only 2 hours away. My uncle lived a hard life...I hope he's at peace and happy now. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>02,April,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Wow! The past couple of days are a total blur. The great news is I got my car on Saturday. The bad news is, that after traveling for two days, I'm just too pooped to write about all the details. I guess it's just gonna have top wait till tomorrow. Nite!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>31,May,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Today was a long ass day. In fact, lately, they've all been long ass days. No business to speak of, makes every hour seem like two. The great news is after tomorrow, I'm off for three days, and heading south on Sunday night to visit my folks for a bit.  I  need  a small getaway, if only overnight. I  need  a change of scenery......... bad !  So I\"ll hit the road, just cruise and unwind a bit, and have a nice visit with Mum and Dad, alone.  Nice . I hope to go to lunch with them at the fire hall on Monday,  and meet all the friends that they're always talking about. Other than that, I'll be happy to just chill on their deck with a cold drink, bullshit the day away, and just enjoy their company.  One more tortureous day of work to go.  Gotta hit the sheets. Nite!                                          \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>30,May,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Thank God I made it back! I thought I was gonna be gone forever..or at least it seemed that way! Anyway, my 'puter had a major nervous breakdown of sorts. A few viruses got through, and wreaked major havoc on my hard drive. Shit. Hubbs tried all kinds of things to get me back and rolling again, but in the end, had to get another hard drive, using my old one as a storage area for the time being. He's still trying to get me completely set up, but in the mean time, I at least have access again.  Along with complete virus protection this time! Don't have to tell me twice. He's put soooo much time into getting this bullshit straightened out for me.......a zillion thanks go out to him. I couldn't do it on my own. Hell no. It's good to have a crew. Real good.

A beautiful day before me, and I have so many things to do, I just don't know where to begin. Damn. All that needs done is inside the house. You see, I live with slobs and the cleaning seems neverending. Lately, it's all beginning to get to me.....working full time and trying to keep up with this house work crap. I'm gonna have to have a serious talk with the guys, and set down some major rules. It's just not fair that I get stuck with all the mess 24/7. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>20,May,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I blew out of \"the grind\" an hour early tonight, and with two lovely days off before me, I be feelin' fine. Indeed. Best of all, they're supposed to be two decent days, weather wise. Finally! I got the title to my Vette in the mail yesterday and I'm hoping that my sticker won't be far behind. I'd like to know what moron decided that we shoud ride around for months with an ugly piece of paper taped to our back windows, untill we get our stickers for our plate. I can't stand to look at the thing anymore, and I run in the house like a little kid everyday to see if the friggin' sticker arrived yet. This is plain stupid. I'm sure I'm not the only one who finds this ridiculous. I mean shit, it's been two months already. Are they engraving it by hand? Idiots. I was a Gabes on my dinner break today, and they had some really neat make-up and nail polish there. So I checked it all out, finally deciding to get a bottle of polish, in a pretty watermellony shade of well..........sparkly watermelon. Tonight I'm putting the polish on, and no matter how many coats I put on, the shit keeps getting LIGHTER!  I'm thinking, am I nuts or what?? Well here I look at the name on the bottle, and it's a \"mood\" nail polish, and it changes from dark to light, in heat and cold. Great. So if I want to see the color that I originally bought it for, I have to keep my hands under cold running water. How convenient.

My day seemed to drag on forever, but it's over now, and I'm so happy to be home and kick my shoes off! On my commute to the \"Grind\" this morning, I heard my new favorite song, \"Feelin' hella good\" on the the radio. I'll tell ya, I really like that song! Had my feet tappin', and my head bobbing up and down!  I really like the video, too.  God I would love to look like Gwen Steffani, if only for a day. Really. Okay..........maybe two days.  A week. That's it, just a week and I'd be satisfied. Really. Well I have to do the dishes then hit the sheets. Sweet dreams all.

It's nuthin' fancy by any means, but at least it's neat and uncluttered. Neat and uncluttered is another way for me to say that I have no talent what-so-ever to do anything fancy! I'm trying to come up with a new name and concept for my page, as this did start out to be a \"group blog\", but now it's turned into a solo act, much to my dismay. Another problem I have is that I don't have time to sit down and write everyday. Ugh. So I need to be able to put short thoughts down, without going into alot of detail. I dunno. So pleasr bear with me as I go through yet another transition. But that's what lifes all about.

Nothing resides inside my head except, \"Damn, I'm glad to be off work for the next two days.\" Nuff said. Hey, the way I figure it, if you want great, inspirational writing, better head out to Barnes and Noble, cause it just aint happenin' here folks. At least not tonight, anyway. My bones are tired, my brain is mushy, and my spirit is weary. Nuthin' that a couple of \"brain-dead days\" won't cure. I think I'm gonna head to the sheets now. Let the \"cure\" begin.

Not that I haven't had anything to write about mind you, I just haven't really given much thought to \"blogging\" lately. I was sick for a week, had company for four days, just finished up a \"7 day stretch\" at work, and in my free time, I take \"Baby\" out for a drive. My house has gone to shit, I haven't even started on my gardens yet, and half the time I'm lucky if I get the laundry done and get my ass to work every day. I'm finally off today, and I'm torn between getting things done around here. or just chillin' and giving myself a well deserved day of R&R. Now Hubbs wouldn't even have a problem in this area. He'd just head off to the golf course, and that would be that!  Hmmmmmmmmmmmm. I wonder if waxing my car qualifies as getting something done around here? Guilt ensues. Ugh.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>28,June,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I can't believe I got up and stayed up this morning, as I don't have to be at work till 2:30. Hmmmm. Hubbs made a hell of alot of noise this morning, waking me from a blissful sleep. I think he enjoys doing that to me.  Then Jr's alarm went off, so I got his breakfast stuff together, and off he went. By this time I was wide awake, so here I am. I had some nice news yesterday. My sister-in-law Debbie e-mailed me that she and my neice Jackie are going to be in our area over the weekend, and they are gonna try to visit us while they're up here. Nice! I hope we can work out a time frame for them to come over for a bit, as I work till 5 on Friday. It will be so great to see them for awhile! I'm excited!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,June,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, another day of testing is over with............Amen. Yesterday, I went and had blood drawn for a series of tests I'm having done, due to that chest pain incident I had last week. No problem, except that it was a \"fasting\" test, which means no food or drink after midnight the night before. Really not a biggie, except that I'm a zombie without my morning java, and it was a bit rough getting the engines started, if you know what I mean. Now today was even more of a bitch, as I had to drive farther, and be there earlier than yesterday. Shit. I swear I was half asleep on my way there, which is a scary thought, considering I was on the interstate. Well they did an ultrasound on my gallbladder, to see if there's been any change in the stone I have floating around in there. They're guessing that I might have had a gallbladder attack on Monday. I guess we'll see. Luckily, I was outta there in no time, and I had brought a thermos of coffee with me, (good thinking huh?), so I'd have an instant fix as soon as I was done. Now here I am, in my car in the parking lot, pouring my coffee into my mug, and this \"parking lot guy\" is like motioning for me to hurry and pull out, as someone was waiting to get into my spot. Now let me interject that there were at least 15 or more spots in this lot, but \"parking lot guy\" takes his job  very seriously  and wants everyone to hustle along as soon as their ass hits the seat of the car. Well I thought, \"fuck you, you idiot, I've been deprived of my coffee all morning, this is currently  my  spot, and I'm gonna sit here 'till either I get a sip of my coffee or Hell freezes over, you choose\". I wish he would have said something to me, cause I was crazed, under-caffinated, and not in the mood to dick around with a parking lot attendant with an attitude. I swear I woulda cracked him a good one. Well, needless to say there were no confrontations, but I did get a few good sips of my coffee before leaving, he leered at me, I rolled my eyes and I was on my way. Nothing too exciting the rest of the day. God it was hot as hell today!  Me and 90 friggin' degrees are not friends. I was really glad to get into the house, and pay homage to the wonderful air conditioner!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>22,June,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Today was one long ass boring day at work.  Add to that, the fact that I felt like shit all day. I have this damn cold, and it's really making me miserable, and edgy. I don't like feeling this way at all. As I was driving home tonight, I thought to myself what a beautiful night for just cruising around. Just perfect. I seriously thought about taking \"Baby\" out for a spin around, but going alone isn't really much fun. Man I had the itch though. Damn.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>20,June,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I took off work today, and it was a good thing I did. I called the doctors office to get an appt. for my ear ache, and they said they had a slot for me in 15 minutes. I'll be there!  Anyway, ear checked out ok, just a clogged tube or something, no biggie. Well, while I was there, I mentioned my incident yesterday, and they decided to set me up with some blood work on Monday, and a sonogram of my gallbladder on Tuesday, suspecting that I might have had a gallbladder attack. I do have a stone in there, but last time I had it checked, there wasn't any reason for concern. Maybe it moved or something.....we'll see on Tuesday. They also gave me an EKG, which read ok. (big relief there) So I feel alot better today, knowing that I'm on the road to getting all this shit figured out. Mid-life bullshit I'll tell ya.  Bites.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>19,June,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well I had one hell of a scare at work yesterday. Around 1pm or so, I got some pains in my chest that brought me to my knees. Damn they were wicked. Joy, my wonderful co-worker and friend, did everything she possibly could to make me comfortable, and help me any way she could. I didn't know what to do, I was freakin' out. (she asked if I needed to go to the hospital, but being a chicken-shit, I said no) I went into the bathroom and layed on the floor, then I went to the recliner isle and stretched out on a recliner for a bit. This was much more comfortable for me, but it was akward as all hell being in a furniture show room with customers strolling by. At the time I didn't care, as at least I was more comfortable than on the bathroom floor. Finally I asked if I could recline in Joys car for a bit, as I had my Vette and that was out of the question. Boss said yeah, Joy said yeah, so out we went to her car, where she opened the windows for me and I reclined the seat. This felt great for awhile........the pain was subsiding, but I was feeling waves of nausea from time to time. My mindset was to head to the bushes if need be. The whole time I felt very out of control because I was at work and away from the comforts of home. Finally I decided that I had to make a break for it and head home. Come hell or high water, I was gonna get my ass home! So I staggered in and told the boss, \"I'm outta here\", got my stuff and headed out to the car. I threw my shoes in the car, ripped off my jacket, and hit the road. I don't even remember driving at all..........just pulling in the drive, dashing in the house and right into bed. By this time I was feeling better, but I needed to sleep. Thank god, after 4 hours of hell, the pain was gone. I was home. God I thought I was gonna die in a furniture store. Thank goodness for my friends.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>19,June,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       I brought Laurels ashes home today. It was a bitter sweet experience.  It was very hard to go to the Vets, and have them hand me a small white box. I went in with a dog, and left with a box. I drove her home in my 'Vette, and I drove slowly, in silence, as a tribute to my old friend on her last ride. I opened the box in the house, and was pleasantly surprised at the beautiful \"urn\" they had put her ashes in. It's a beautiful pottery piece, highly glazed, with muted colors of blues and browns. Very pretty. They were also kind enough to include a nice card with her paw print on the front, a beautiful verse inside, and a tiny bag of her fur. I put everything on our buffet, along with her photo, and her favorite ball..........amongst our family photos. She was indeed family. The circle is complete. My girl is home.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>14,June,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, I'm back. Still getting over not having my furry friend around, but it's getting better everyday. I'm still waiting for the vet to call me so I can go and pick up her ashes and bring them home. Then the cycle will be complete. My parents were up for a few days, and we had a really nice visit. We celebrated Hubbies birthday on Sunday with a steak dinner and lots of gifts. On Monday, I went with my Mom to Agway and got all the plants for our veggie garden, then up to Scotland Yard Nursery for some flowers and herbs. My Dad went golfing with Hubby, so they were enjoying the morning in their \"guy\" way, while Mom and I had our own fun!. To be continued........\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>05,June,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       In Memory of our beloved Laurel........Gone but never to be forgotten   December ?, 1986 - June 4, 2002   Today is a very sad day for me. For all of our family. We said goodbye to our furry family member and best friend, Laurel. She was very special to us. To me. To let her go today, was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, even though I know it was for the best. Knowing it was for the best doesn't make it any easier, though. My heart is broken. I miss my friend. Rest in peace my baby girl. I (we) love you.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>02,June,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n        I'm awake and moving, with lots to do before I head out later in the afternoon. I have to keep moving along  towards getting things together, as thoughts in my head keep saying to stay home and get stuff done around here. Sometimes being a Capricorn is tuff, as I always seem to want to do the \"practical\" things and not the fun stuff. Like no play till the work is done. Well I figure the work is  never  done, so hell with it! I'm outta here after dinner! Adios!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>02,June,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      This is a  perfect  night, with a cool breeze blowing throught the windows, a zillion sparkly stars in the sky and no sounds but the crickets.  This is what Spring's all about. This is wonderful. I'm gonna go to bed and enjoy the night breeze blowing across my face as I fall asleep. Nitey nite. Sweet dreams.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>31,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I know it's late, as I have to be up at 5:00 in the morning, but I just can't sleep yet. I thought maybe typing for awhile would make my eyes tired and then I'd want to crash out. Or not. I think I'm just trying to drag out the evening as long as possible, so morning will take longer to get here. I don't want to go in the morning at all. I have had all my parts and pieces  for all these years, and I'm not thrilled about   having one of them taken out, even if it is bad. A part of me just wants to jump in my Vettester and head anywhere.......fast!  The other part of me just wants to get it over with, and get back home to my comfy bed. Better hide the Vette keys.............just in case! Just kidding. Oh oh, it's midnight now. No more drinks or eats for me. :O(  Next meal will be hospital grub................yum!   Wish me luck, eh? Nite. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.  (I hope)\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>29,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I talked to my Mom this morning, and she said that she totally understands my not wanting them to come up, as I will be in the guest room for a couple of days, and Nick will have everything taken care of. Phew......................that's a  load  off my mind. I was soooooo afraid that her feelings were gonna be hurt, and she'd be upset. I'll never figure that woman out. Anyway, one less thing to worry about. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>29,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well I found out this morning that my surgery is at 7:45am tomorrow, and that I have to be there at 6am. Ugh. Good thing is that I'm the first operation of the day, so hopefully my doctor will be fresh as a daisy when I roll in. God I hope he's not a drinker and hungover. *shudders* I'm a tad bit nervous today, but I've been so busy around here getting things ready, that I haven't had much time to think about it. (I planned it that way) \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>29,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I am not at all cool with this surgery shit. I hope I don't freak out or something. Just pre-operative jitters I guess. If I'm missing on Thursday morning........I've driven to Nevada. Or somewhere equally far.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>28,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      The picnic at Ed's house was really nice, despite the threatening weather we were having when we left home. Up at his place, it wasn't raining at all, which was a nice surprise. We all just sat on their deck, bullshitting and eating. Very relaxed and easy going type get-together, which was nice. I'm really not a big party person, so I didn't know how this was gonna turn out, but it was a super nice time. There were only 10 of us, so it was easy to talk. Only problem for me was that I couldn't eat any of the delicious ranch dip they servrd with the veggies. See, I luv ranch dressing. Oh well. Twas not to be, for me.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>28,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Nick and I are going to a picnic at Ed's (one of my co-workers) house today. Should be nice, if it ever stops raining. I made a pineapple upsidedown cake last night, and I must say it looks really good! Of course the way I've been eating lately, everything looks really good to me. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>26,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I have two new obsessions. Self-tanning and hair removal. Not only do I have Nair, but also Neet and shave gel, and I'm also looking to find that new Veet stuff. I think it's just a phase. I dunno.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I have been in a pretty great frame of mind lately, and no it's not because of the Vicodin I took last night. I have been losing quite a bit of weight due to my gallbladder attack in late June. See I haven't been eating anything greasy or fatty, and I've really cut down on my sugar consumption too. Well, it's really beginning to show, and I'm enjoying every minute of this shit, I'll telll ya! Hell ya. I've wanted to lose weight ever since I had Nick, (almost 20 years ago!!), but till now I never really had the motivation to do so. Well, if having pain in your chest that's so intense that it feels like a heart attack, and lasts for 4 hours isn't motivation..........I don't know what the hell would be. Nuff said. If I never eat that stuff again it'll be too soon. Anyway, everyone at work is like freaked out by how good I'm starting to look, and I must say I feel better too. And my co-workers are starting to work out, and watch what they eat, so it makes me feel good to be sort of a motivating factor for them. See, take a bad situation and turn it into something good. This is what we are doing. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Damn did my mouth hurt last night..............I just wanted to rip my friggin' head off! I took 2 Vicodin, and they barely took the edge off. Luckily when I woke up today, I was feeling alot better. What a night.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>24,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I went to the hospital this morning for my pre-op testing. The two worst parts of the ordeal were, no coffee and finding a parking spot. I ended up parking in the lot, and luckily I had just enuff quarters to cover my time there. The testing part wasn't bad at all......answered a few health questions, had a chest x-ray, and gave a bit of blood. The woman that drew the blood samples was fantastic...............I didn't even know the needle was in my hand. Yeah, they have to take it from my hand because the veins are too deep in my arm, and no one ever gets to them without causing me alot of pain, and me wanting to punch them in the face for hurting me. The only part that got to me a bit, (alot), was when the gal that was talking to me about the anestesia, told me that they would be putting a tube down my throat to help me breathe, but I would be asleep when they did.  Whoopteeshit . I don't want a friggin' tube down my throat................ ever !  Asleep or not.  I'm not happy about this at all. After all that, I went and had a root canal. Hopefully my tooth will stop driving me nuts now. Fun morning, huh?\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>23,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Here we go again kiddies.............I managed to screw up the 'puter  again . Friggin' screensavers. I swear I'll never, ever download another one again. F'n smack me silly if I do, ok?  The damn thing didn't cause any problems when it ran............only after I un-installed it. (The real bitch is that I didn't even  like  the damn screensaver!)  Now, even though I can still use the pc, it does odd shit that it didn't do before. I don't think it's a bug, as I did a complete system virus scan, and it came up negative. Just enuff bullshit to piss me off ya know? Just enuff. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>18,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, I made it to the  suck-ass  meeting at 9 am this morning. The bosses just think it's so friggin' cute that they can drag us in on our day off, and brow beat us for a half an hour in the name of \"training\".  Bite me .  Anyhow, with that out of the way, I can now figure what I'm gonna do with the rest of my day. I don't know if my brother-in-law and his family are gonna be up tomorrow or not. If they are, I have to clean out the guest room  pronto . If not, well then I can kinda chill all day, except for getting my stuff ready for work this week. I hope I hear from someone, soon so I know what the hell to do.   Yesterday I went to the Library, to see if they had any Pilates books I could borrow, instead of ordering them from my bookclub. I don't want to get stuck with books if they suck. Well they didn't have them at our branch, so they're having them brought in from the main library. Should be here today, I hope. I've been losing alot of weight, but I need to tone up too, and I've heard that the Pilates workout is very good for toning and aiding in flexibility. I'll give it a shot and see if I notice any good results. While I was at the library, I realized that it had been sooooooo long since I'd used the damn thing, that I had  forgotten  how to use it!!! Like, are things listed by Author or title? I felt like a real dumbass, but a sweet woman there said she completely understood. I'd bet money that she called me a \"dumbass\" when I left. That's okay. As  long as she gets my books, I don't care what she thinks about me.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>16,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I am soooo happy to be off for two days! Sometimes I think we need two days off for every two worked, it just sucks so bad there anymore. Anyway, enuff talk about the \"Grind\" for now. I am sleeping in tomorrow,  no matter what , and I am not going to let anyone or anything, (excluding maybe a house fire!), get me out of bed until I want to get out. And that's that!!  See, my attempts to sleep in have been thwarted by one thing or another over the past few weeks, and over the next few weeks, I'm not going to have any mornings off,  that I don't either have an appointment or a meeting of some sort. Sleeping late is my one true pleasure........I adore it. So everyone around here has been warned not to wake me. Won't be pretty if they do. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>12,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      My day was uneventful, except for when my tooth went ape shit on me for awhile, and I was in so much pain that I wanted to hack my head off. I resolved the problem, and the rest of the evening was a breeze. Amen. Now all I need to do is pack, shower and hit the sheets. We're leaving at 10 in the morning, and I don't want to be draggin' my ass all day, so I'm gonna get a good nights sleep. We should have a nice visit, as the weather is going to be great, and I'm looking forward to seeing everyone at the reunion. Nite!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I should be in bed right now, but seeing as I don't have to be at work till 2:30, I'm pushing it a bit. Yesterday kinda sucked from the get-go. I woke up with the whole left side of my face swollen from my damn tooth. Beautiful. Good news is that I wasn't in as much pain as I was Wednesday night. I can't stand the pain. Anyway, I got alot of stuff done today, and hopefully all I have to do to tonight is pack and wrap up a few loose ends. Then it's off to the reunion on Saturday morning. Nite.....pain pill kicking in!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I have an abcessed tooth. Left side of face is swollen and throbbing, even though I saw the Dentist this morning, and he opened the tooth up to drain, and gave me antibiotics. Damn I hate this shit..........it ruined my whole day off. I just took some more pain meds, grabbed the ice bag, and I'm going to bed. Hopefully by morning, the antibiotics will have kicked in and the swelling will have gone down. Damn it. I look like a freak. :O(   (LIke Goldie Hawn in The First Wives Club, after she had that terrible botox \"lip job\"!)\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>09,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, I went to the consultation yesterday, and yes, the \"S\" word was used. Surgery. The ole Gallbladder gotta go. Deep inside I knew it, but I didn't want to hear it. August 1st is the big day, and our 21st Wedding Anniversary to boot. I guess I'll never forget this coming anniversary, huh? Anyway, the date is set, now all I have to do is some preliminary tests in a week or so. I'm a bit nervous about the whole ordeal, mostly because of  surgery horror stories you always hear about. I know, I'm dramatic at times, but I heard about these people that when they were put under, they still felt all the pain from the surgery, but they couldn't move or speak to alert anyone! Now wouldn't that be a bitch? Shit. Anyhow, I'm gonna try not to dwell on it. But I am nervous. I am. Sissy me.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I have a neurotic Hamster.

I'm a bit nervous, but I'm not gonna get all whacked about it............yet. Part of me is anxious to get this all over with, as I'm really scared to have another attack. But another part of me doesn't want to hear the word \"surgery\", as I haven't had an operation since I was about 5 or so, and had my tonsils removed. I puked. I remember  that . I never heard of the Doctor that they referred me to, so I don't even know who I'm seeing today. No matter how I look at this, it bites. I guess I just have to go and see what he has to say. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,July,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Tonight , I came home from work hot, sticky, miserable, with a throbbing headache and a stiff neck. Work was so friggin' hot that the customers were even commenting about it. By 8pm I had all I could take of the bullshit. I need to dig up something cool to wear tomorrow, and I really don't feel like doing anything right now, but taking a cool shower and hitting the sheets. Not to be though.......gotta get a few things done before I reach that point.

Yesterday, they came over the house around 6 or so, and we just sat outside on the patio and chatted about anything and everything. Very relaxing and enjoyable. It is so nice when you have people visit, that just go with the flow, sit back and chill for awhile and share a few laughs. They headed back to their hotel around 8:30 or so, as they were pooped from riding bikes around the Penninsula, and swimming. When they were leaving, we made loose plans to meet today to do some shopping. Deb called me this morning, ( they slept in just like I did!), and we decided to meet at 2 to do a bit of browsing and bullshitting. We met up, and shopped for about an hour, then decided to go eat at Paneras Breads. Goooood lunch! We all had the soup, sandwhich, salad deal, and just chatted and laughed like the loons we are! I guess we were ther around an hour. when they figured it was time to hit the road. We said our \"good-byes\" and they were on their way home. A short, but wonderful visit. I really wish we lived  closer to eachother so that we could do things like that more often.  *sigh*  Well, I guess it's off to bed for me, as I have a long ass day to get thru tomorrow, and I'm worthless if I'm tired. Off to dreamland! Nite! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>31,August,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Damn I'm tired. These 7 day stretches are killers, I'll tell ya, and the fact that 3 people have been fired over stupid crap, only adds more tension to the whole thing. Thankfully I (we)  only have three more days to grind through. I feel like the group cheerleader right now, trying to keep everyopns spirits up, and keep 'em all motivated. Not an easy task at this point in time. I'm mentally fried!

Nuthin' much new in La La Land anyway.........hmmmmmm lemme see.........this past week has been interesting at work. We got a new guy, Jacob, on our team, which thrills us to no end, as we haven't enuff business for the 5 of us, let alone one more. Anyway, Jacob is 54 and is from Liberia. Needless to say, we can't understand a freakin' thing he says. We just nod alot or keep saying \"huh?\" like a bunch of morons. He also says he's a preacher, so he can't work any Sundays. I can't wait to see how the boss handles this shit. If he gives this guy Sundays off, royal hell is gonna break loose. So things have been a bit interesting on the sales floor with the \"new blood\" around. I don't think he's going to last very long. Most don't in our neck of the woods.   Tomorrow, Hubbs and I are going to Ron's (a fellow salesman), for a  picnic at his trailor by the lake. The guys are going to go golfing, while us gals bullshit and treasure hunt on the beach! I think it will be a nice time for everyone, with lots of good food and strange characters! I love it! And yes, I am one of those strange characters! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>13,August,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Three wonderful days of blissful relaxation are coming to an end.

Healing myself after surgery has been priority one, so this took a bit of a back seat. Let's bring things up to speed, shall we?  Friday August 9   Saw the doctor in the afternoon, and he took off my little steri-strips, and gave me two \"thumbs up\" on my progress. Great. Off to work for 6 hours, my first day back in over a week. It was really nice when I walked in the door at work, everyone saying they missed me, and were glad to see me back. Nice to be missed and needed. Needless to say it made me feel wonderful! The day was okay, although as I got toward evening, my stomach began to cramp up a bit. Uncomfortable, but I can deal with it. It's just letting me know that there's still mending going on in  there. Easy does it, now.   Saturday August 10  Headed off to work in the morning for a 7 hour day. Nothing to eventful to report about my day, my sales were shit, and by 5, I was ready to head home for three days of R&R.   Sunday August 11 What a wonderful way to start the day........sleeping in till 11, then Hubbs made us all pancakes that were soooooo yummy! Nick and I rode up to Erie to get him some new shoes. We found one pair at Value city Dept. Store and one at DSW Warehouse. I think he was happy with what he found, and I was happy to spend some time with him. Later in the day, I took the \"Vettester\" out for a couple of drives, and then just chilled out at the house the rest of the day. Great Sunday indeed!   Monday August 12  I saw a neat little CD boombox in a Circuit City ad in the Sunday paper, so I decided to drive up and get one. I picked one up, drove home, and the freakin' remote didn't work. Shit I was pissed, as now I'd have to drive back up there and get another one. Now it's not that it's a long drive, about 15 minutes is all, but I wasn't in the mood to waste my time going back where I just was. I have better things to do on my day off. well, I packed it all up, and headed back to the store. This time I had the chick there test it out for me, and she was really nice about the whole thing. As I headed out, I thought I hadn't been to Platos closet for awhile, so I stopped in and found two really sharp tops for $5.00 each! I love this bargain shopping shit. It's like a friggin' drug to me! Then I drove over to Nicks work, but he was busy in the stock room and I didn't want to bother him. So I told his boss to tell him that I'd stopped by, and I was outta there.  Well, since I was next to a Fashion Bug, I thought what the hell, pop in and see what they have to tempt me with. I found a cut pair of seersucker pants 50% off, so they were only like $3.75 or something, and I found two colognes I liked, and they were only 2/$10.00! Yeeeha! Jackpot again! Well, after all this I haeded home as I was starving. I ate a mac and cheese dinner, put on my new lounge pants, and spritzed on a bit of my new cologne. Oh, and a bit of cool jazz on the boombox..........life sure is good. Nuff said  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,August,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Better day today. I'm starting to feel more like \"myself\", with a tad bit more energy than I've had in a while. Yesterday was not a good day  at all . I felt like my guts went two rounds with a heavyweight boxer, and yeah, he won.............big time!  Then I had a squabble with my \"caregiver\" in the evening. Glad that's over with. It's such a gorgeous day out today, in the mid 70's, that I was able to enjoy being outside in my gardens for awhile. Nice. It really lifted my spirits to be outside on such a splendid day, with the sky a caribbean blue, dotted with whispy white clouds. Life is good.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,August,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Tonights post falls under the \"Nuckin' futs\" catagory.

Actually, I've been home since Friday morning, but this is the first time I've really felt like sitting here and writing. Everything went well surgically, and one nite in the hospital was more than enuff for me. I hated it, and there was no way they were even gonna think of keeping me another day. Now that I'm home, I mostly take my pain  meds and sleep, and walk around the house a bit. But I am feeling better every day. It's just good to be home.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>29,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Work went well today. We had a steady customer flow, and I wrote a couple of nice deals, which made me a happy camper. Right now my mind is on next week, when I'll have almost a week off. I'll actually have six days off, but that's fine with me! The following weekend, we (Hubbs, Nick, Amanda and myself)  go to New York City for my nephews wedding. So I'll have two lovely weekends without bullshit! It just doesn't get any better than this, folks!  *does the happy dance*\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>28,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Note to self: Always remember, it's the struggles that make you strong.

The drive down was really relaxing, and the Vettester ran like a dream. She sure loves the highway! I got in around 3:15, and we had coffee and talked awhile. My Mom told me that if I didn't mind, we were going out to my Aunt Pats house for a visit. Hell I didn't mind at all, as I haven't seen her since last year at NIcks graduation party. We discussed dinner, and decided that we were going to eat out at Old Country Buffet, which is up near my Aunts house. Dinner was good, and I made a second plate, which I haven't done for months. I skipped dessert though, and it was a bit rough going, as my Mom had a wonderful piece of cheesecake for her dessert, and it was hard for me not to go and get myself a piece too. But I hung tough, and went outside for a smoke instead. We went into a few small shops in the plaza there, which was nice. We drove over to my Aunts house, and when we went in, she screamed, \"Barbie!\", and gave me a huge hug and kiss! Wow, that was nice. We visited for about 2 hours or so, then drove back to my folks place, where I hit the sheets around 11:30, exhausted from going to bed too late the night before.   On Thursday, I got up at 9A.M., as we had to be at the fire hall by 10:30 for lunch set -up. My folks belong to a seniors group that has their lunches every weekday at the fire hall, and when I'm in for a visit, I love to go have lunch with them. They are all so sweet, and very entertaining! The only thing is, the meals are mediocre to say the least, but I eat it all, smile and say it was great anyway. I figure it wouldn't be very nice to say, \"damn, lunch sucked again!\" For some of them, it's probably the best thing they eat all day. Well, we left there around 12:30 and headed to a re-sale shop a few minutes away, where we browsed and had a nice time looking at some pretty decent things, I must say. I ended up buying a nice black and white houndstooth print skirt, (brand new with tag still on!) for $2.00, and a cool pair of earrings. My Mom got a pretty heart bracelet and Dad came away with a pair of dress slacks. A nice time, and I didn't spend alot of ching. ( I wore the skirt to work today, and it looked great!) We headed back to the house after about an hour in the shop, and just kinda got my things together and gabbed a bit more. I was pissed because it was raining and it just wouldn't let up at all. Shit. Well, I headed for home at 4:15 P.M., driving in the rain till I was almost half way here. By the time I got home, my car was almost dry, (thanks to a good wax job, that water just blew off!), so I didn't have to wipe her down when I got in. Amen for that, because I was a bit \"road weary\" and just wanted to unwind a bit before doing laundry and getting things ready for work today. I had a really nice time, and I'm so glad that I made up my mind to just do it. I need to do this sort of thing more often.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      You know how every once in awhile, we have those days where everything seems out of our control, and no matter how hard we try, it just doesn't get any better? Well, I've had  two of those days in a row , and thank god I'm off tomorrow. And my solution to keeping my sanity, (or what little I have left), is to get the hell out of Dodge. Yupper, I figure a little road trip will do the old psyche alot of good, so I'm heading down south to pay Mom and Dad a little visit. Short and sweet.......long enuff to be enjoyable,  but short enuff as not to cause further brain damage. Just me and the Vettester and the open road....... sweet . I'll be back thursday.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>23,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I know I'm gonna pay big time tomorrow for staying up so late, but as I was flicking channels earlier, I came upon  urlLink Disturbed  live at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. I've never seen them live, so I was glued to the set for the last half hour or so. Damn they put on one hell of a good show. The lead singers voice is just mezmerizing to me. Very talented group. I like!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>22,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I really enjoyed having the day off today. I slept in 'till 11, then got myself together to go out and spruce up my cars a bit. I swept out the New Yorker, dusted and polished a bit, and I must admit, it looks 100% better with minimal effort on my part. Then I Tackled the Vette with some detail spray, window cleaner and Armor All. I gave her a good sweeping, and she was all prettied up. Hubbs and I were gonna go for a little cruise, but it turned ugly dark, and started to rain. Needless to say, we'll have to go some other time. :( Right now I'm kinda beat, so I think I might take a little nappie poo.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>19,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, I met with Diane on Thursday, and I'm officially selling Avon again. Love it! In fact, I got my first order from Donna at work today. Only problem is, the office manager, Michelle, told me to keep my Avon stuff on the \"down low\" from the boss, because he wasn't happy that the office girls had brought in some kind of garden party stuff. Whatever. I just told all the ladies to keep the books hidden, so I don't get my ass in a wringer, and put a damper on things. Hopefully, I won't get \"found out\", and this will all work out wonderfully, as planned.   I'm pretty happy to be off work today. I mean it's my first Sunday off in 4 weeks! I hope it's decent out, as I want to give my cars a good cleaning. Especially the New Yorker, as I've pretty much ignored it all summer, and it shows! I did take it to the shop on Thursday as planned, and Dave was nice enuff to weld the exhaust pipe for me so it don't sound like a ghetto car anymore. Amen to that! I was tired of getting those \"fix your car\" looks from people. Although I just gave em the\"mind your own fuckin' business\" look right back. Works for me. Nite.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>19,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Yesterday went by in a blurr. I hate that, because I long for my days off, and when they kinda just fly by, it annoys the hell out of me. Diane, the Avon district manager called me yesterday, and I'm meeting her at Perkins today to get my ass signed up to sell again. I also put the bug in her ear that I want to do alot more than just sell. I think she got my point, as she mentioned that she does need people to help her sign on new sales people, being she has 2 districts now and the pressure is on. I'll see her today, get my stuff and see what happens. But if I know me, I'll be zinging along in no time. If I want something, I get it. Always. I honestly can't remember a time when I didn't. So this should work out fine. the only thing that is gonna be a bit tough is fitting it in with my already filled work schedual. I'll figure it out as I go, I guess.   It sucks that I have to be at a meeting at 9 AM on my day off. Asshole managers. The good thing is that I can sleep in a bit on Friday morning, because I don't start till 2:30. Thank goodness for that!  After my meeting, I go to meet Diane about the Avon stuff, then I have a 2:00 appointment to get my exhaust pipe welded on my New Yorker. So there goes my day today.  Shot....to....hell. But it's better than any day at work!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>16,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Today was one of those days, when I was wishing it was over, before it even began. I was physically tired, and my brain was like Jello. I drank coffee, and even had one of those \"energy drinks\" to help boost me along, but I was getting frustrated and tired no matter what I did. I felt like busting Jacob in the mouth when he said' \"Look, only 8 more hours to go!\" Instead I just muttered \"shut the fuck up\" under my breath. He didn't quote the time again the rest of the day. I'm home now, and I feel like I got run over by a steamroller...........twice. I need major zzzzzzzz's and I think I'm gonna head in that direction now. Nite.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>15,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Ya know, every year I see it, but I still can't believe it..........Christmas stuff on the shelves in September. Gimme a break! Do people really need 3 &1/2 months to buy decorations for the holiday? Really. In one stop, you can pick up your Fall, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas decorations. I think it's plain stupid, and it takes all the fun and anticipation out of it all. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>15,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I picked up a little treat for myself on the way home tonight. Kit Kat has two special edition bars out, one with white chocolate and one with dark chocolate. I tried both........dark chocolate was a winner with me!     I had a neat idea while I was at work today. I think I'm going to sell Avon again. Just the other day, I was wishing I still had my Avon Rep around, as I used to buy quite a bit from her, and I really like their products. Then it hit me..........I should just sell it, even if just at work and to friends. That way I could get it whenever I need to, and make a bit of change on the side. Even if only enuff to pay for my own stuff. Who knows, maybe I'll even try for manager like I did before I moved up here. We'll see about that, but as for now, I e-mailed the company and said I'd like to be a rep again. Now all I have to do is wait to hear from them. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>11,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Update on Ryan: He finally was able to go home on Thursday, after mucho bullshit. I haven't talked to him, but I'm sure he's very happy to be back home.  Now the legal battle begins, with a hearing and such. I'll give the details as I get them.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>11,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      As of tonight, Ry is  still  in the County Jail, and  really scared . Poor guy. He's just a sweet , big hearted country boy from Arkansas, who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Could happen to any of us, ya know?  Picture this. He's in a business suit, walking to a sales call, and mother nature calls. So he ducks into an alley, discretely goes behind a dumpster, and takes care of business as  fast  as possible. Well, some woman was walking by, spotted him behind the dumpster, and runs and gets the cops.  Four  squad cars come, and arrest him in the alley, and off he goes to County, where he can't even make a call till he's arraigned. He was arrested at 11am, and it took till midnight for him to get a call out. Today there has been alot more red tape and bullshit. Hopefully he'll be out of there tomorrow.......poor guy. Why couldn't that bitch just mind her own friggin business? And 4 squad cars!!! Please! And aren't there drug dealers and felons out there that they should be paying closer attention to? If he were getting mugged in that alley, would that woman have run and got the police? Would 4 cars have come in seconds? I think not. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, after a long night of no information, we finally got some news this morning. Good news is Ryan is fine, bad news is he's in the County Jail. Yeah, it seems he was arrested for pissing in an alley. Can you believe that shit? Now why he didn't or couldn't call anyone is beyond me. I mean aren't you supposed to get one phone call when your arrested? Naturally we were all thinking the worst last night, and that could have all been avoided if he had just called his wife and told her where he was. At least we wouldn't have spent the night thinking that he might be lying dead somewhere. At least he's okay physically. Now to get him out of the \"klink\"!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I'm  really  nervous right now. My sister-in-law Maureen called a bit ago, and she's worried because her hubby Ryan has like, disapeared. He left for work at 7A.M. this morning, didn't call her all day, (which is unusual), isn't home yet, and she gets his voice mail when she calls his cell. I'm really worried, as Ryan is a pretty responsible guy, with two little kids at home and one on the way, and he's not gonna just go out and do stupid shit like not call or come home. She's going to drive to his office, and see if she sees his vehicle there. She said she called the police and hospitals, and they told here that ther have been no accidents in the area. That doesn't mean diddly though, because you can go off the road ond over a hillside and no one would be the wiser. Please be okay Ry. I hope they call and say he's ok. Damn.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      See \"Nuckin' Futs\" for todays post!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well I'm pretty pleased. I got Nick an appointment at the Cleveland Clinic Spine Center on Monday the 9th! I was really surprised that they were able to see him so soon. Now I just hope that they can help him in a non evasive way, as I feel that surgery should be a final option, and we really haven't persued all the avenues that are out there yet. Well this is a start, and I guess I'll know alot more on Monday night.   I started my work out tonight. Not too much to start with, just some stretching, a few push ups and a few leg and stomach exercises. I need to start out slowly, despite my good intentions, as it's been years since I've worked out, and I don't want to get up tomorrow feeling like I got hit by a semi! It feels good to be getting back in the groove again. I know I can see this through.......yes indeedee!   So far my sales this month are great, and if I can keep it up, September might just be a great month for me. God knows I need it already. Moolah is a bit scarce with itsy bitsy commission checks, and I hate it when the check book is tight. No fun there. I need to get some new work clothes soon! Damn , most of them are so big now that I look totally stupid in them..........like I borrowed someone elses clothes. I'm not complaining, it's just that I have  alot  of clothes that I can't wear now, so it's like I wear the same three outfits to work everyday. Sucks. Good news is........yeah you got it...........shopping trip! See, there's always a rainbow! I better get to bed. I'm starting to sound dorky. Nite! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>02,September,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I swear, if smoking doesn't kill me, my job sure as hell will. Today was \"balls to the walls\" for 7 hours, with only 4 of us sales people on the floor. Damn it was brutal. As I was waiting on one customer, I had at least three more waiting for me to help them.  I am so friggin' tired, that I can't even think straight. Ugh! I think I'm gonna hit the sheets soon here, as I have an 11 hour day ahead tomorrow, but then two wonderful, (and well deserved!), days off!  Can't wait.  On the weight topic.....I'm pretty excited, as I feel I can now begin my \"abs training\". So far my stomach hasn't been achy for about a week or so, and I figure that means everything is healed up in there. That's a green light for me to start \"crunching\", and doing various stuff to hopefully trim the \"chunky monkey\" and the ole hips. The gals at work have been cutting out articles pertaining to ab work-outs for me, which I thought was a sweet thing to do. They're rooting for me big time!  The other day on my dinner break, I found a  great  dress for my nephews wedding in October. It's a sheath dress with a jacket, in black, with a ton of little white dots all over. Sharp. And it's slinky, but not too clingy. I think it's perfect, except for the fact that it's too long and needs hemmed to cocktail length. So I have to call a seamstress and get it done soon. I would also like to get a pair of sexy shoes that I saw at DSW Warehouse, if they still have them. They have a neat ankle strap, and I've always wanted a pair like that, so here's my excuse to get them!  I love shopping  way too much  for my own good!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>31,October,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I forgot to mention that the asshole who broke into my house tonight, also took a bag of Halloween candy on his way out.

Drivers adapting to the changing weather. They usually fall into one of two catagories: 1) \"The Fearless\"  &  2) \"The Paranoid\"  The \"Fearless\" drivers feel that they can handle  any  road condition at  any  speed. In fact, the faster the better. Now the \"Paranoid\" drivers are so freaked out by the snow, that they creep at a snails pace, in fear of losing total control, if God forbid, they went over 15 MPH. Both are a pain in the ass, and both are a hazard on the road. Especially if you end up with a \"snail\" in front of you, and \"The Roadrunner\" behind you. As the snow season approaches, I dread the \"drivers\", not the snow!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>28,October,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I woke up this morning, with the realization that Nicks birthday is next Tuesday, and I haven't even started getting anything for him. Shit. So on my way home from having rear shocks put on my car, I stopped at Wal Mart, and picked up a few small things. During my dinner hour tomorrow, I'll head out and hopefully find a few more items he would like.    P.S.- There is this new body spray stuff that they have out now for men. Well, I had to test all 5 scents, and after about two minutes or so, as I walked away, there were about a dozen people gagging all over the place, going \"what's that *$%@** smell\"?  So guys, don't wear all 5 at one time.

I was just watching this piece on VH1 about the band Kiss, who I just  loved  in the 70's. I mean I thought they were the shit back then, and I was totally in love with Paul Stanley. In fact, I even had my picture taken with full Paul stanley make-up on, and I almost looked like his friggin' twin sister or something. (I wish I still had that photo!) Anyway, as I was watching them tell their story, and listening to their music, all I could think to myself was, \"Man, they suck\".  I don't think there's any other music I listened to then, that I could actually say that about. Oops...................I forgot about Alice Cooper!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>27,October,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Happy Sunday! I work from 12 till 6 today, then two fabulous days off! And to add even more enjoyment to my day, I can drive the 'Vettester to work, because there's no rain in the forecast. This will be her last drive of the season, as I'm putting her away for the winter on Monday. This car is way too much fun.

Put away the Summer garb, and bring out the Winter clothes........and the Halloween decorations. I really don't know how much Halloween stuff I'm gonna put up this year, as I work till 9 on Halloween and I don't know if Jr. will be working late too. See he and I are the ones that dress up and spook the kids on Halloween night. Although who knows, Hubbs might be motivated to put on a mask and scare some Trick or Treaters that night. Trust me, it's a blast! And they really love it too. At least that's what I've been told over the years. I'll miss not being here this year. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>20,October,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Today was the perfect, lazy Sunday! I slept in a bit, washed up and just lazed around the house with a cup of coffee in hand,' till around noon or so. Then I got my \"face on\", and went to the store to get a nice roast for dinner. Came back, and put the roast,(and carrots, onions, and mushrooms) in the oven on low. Hubbs got a shower, then we headed to Geneva on the Lake for a nice, relaxing Sunday drive in the Vettester. It was so nice just cruising along looking at all the beautiful leaves, and just talking and laughing at stupid things along the way. Geneva was a really nice place to see, with it's cute cottages and beautiful views of the lake. We decided that next summer, we are going to have to spend some time there.  We came home, and I went back out to get gas and head up to Wal Mart to get a hair bleaching kit for Nick. Well, actually for me, as I bleach his hair for him......lazy ass. By the time I got back, the roast was done, Nick came in from work, and we had a yummy, \"just like grandma's\" dinner. It was so nice to eat something homemade for a change! Tonight, I bleached Nicks hair, and now I'm relaxing at my 'puter, enjoying what's left of this wonderful Sunday evening. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>19,October,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Love is a wonderful thing.........but at times, it sucks big time   It's times like these, that I'm glad to be in a long-term relationship, that I believe has weathered the worst of the storms. And hadn't it been for a ton of determination, dedication, love, stubborness, (throw in a touch of good luck), and a willingness to bend a bit, I don't think we'd have made it for 25 years. Being in love is a rough ride, sometimes.  Right now, a couple of young people I care alot about, are going through some rough times, and it's very hard to be on the sidelines, and stay impartial. But I am. And it breaks my heart to see them struggle, although I know that this is a natural process, and it happens to all of us at one time or another. Sometimes, alot. Still it bites. I'm not good at this stuff........seeing people unhappy. I always feel like I can fix things. But in matters of the heart, that are not my own, I can't. And it bites. I see the tears, and I remember well, when they were my tears. I see the anger, and I remember my anger. I see the games. Damn it ,I hate the fuckin' games. I never was a game player, but was always on the receiving end. A strong partnership is built and made stronger by conflicts resolved and learned from. But damn it, don't play friggin' games. They only cause hurt, and don't accomplish  anything  meaningful. And if you think you're a badass cause you play them, well you're not. You're an asshole, plain and simple.   Well, with all that said, all I can do is be here to love and support those two beautiful hearts that are having a rough time right now. (You know who you are) I may not be able to change anything, but maybe I can tell you a few stories that might bring a smile to your face or let you  know that you're not alone in your struggles. And always, a shoulder to cry on and arms to hug you tight. Remember, we've all been there at one time or another. You'll be okay. Promise. *Hugs*\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>19,October,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I've seen this on other sites, and I thought it was kinda neat, so I thought I'd give it a whirl too! The infamous  urlLink \"Friday Five\"  1.  How many TVs do you have in your home ?   We have 4.  2.  On average, how much TV do you watch in a week ?   Not much actually, maybe 3 hours, tops. 3.  Do you feel that television is bad for young children ?    It depends on what they're watching. When my son was young, he lived on Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers. No violent programs! 4.  What TV shows do you absolutely HAVE to watch, and if you miss them, you're heartbroken ?     None. 5.  If you had the power to create your own television network, what would your line-up look like ?     It would be a cross between MTV and Friends. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>18,October,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Want to check out a Blog that's different from the norm?

So, after searching around for a place to eat, with no luck, I looked at the window right next to where we were standing, and it was a Howard Johnstons Restaurant. With a few empty tables! In we went, without hesitation. We were seated quickly, and needless to say, we were elated to not only be out of the pouring rain, but on our way to full bellies. Our waiter introduced himself as Raul, but Hubbs kept calling him Ron. Hubbs and I each ordered Reubens and fries, Amanda ordered a chicken sandwhich with fries and Nick had his usual burger and fries. While we waited for our orders to come, some crazy looking characters took seats in the booth next to ours, and I saw this as a photo op, so I got a couple of photos of the locals.

Yeah, I know I didn't post anything about the trip coming up, but last week I was lucky I had time to breathe, let alone post.  Anyway, despite feeling exhausted, I had a  wonderful  time! The drive wasn't too bad, considering I'm not one to really love traveling (driving) all that much. The scenery was spectacular, with the mountains covered in multi-colored foilage, although on our trip there, it was a dreary day with fog and drizzle. The ride home today was sunny and clear, so we were able to see more than we did going.   We arrived on Saturday around 3ish, checked into our rooms, and just hung out for a bit.  After we unpacked and relaxed, we headed out to find Times Square. With map in hand, Hubbs manuvered us along the highways, through the tunnel and into New York City without a hitch! We parked, and before you knew it, we were looking at Times Square right in front of us! Woo hoo, it's one crazy friggin' place I'll tell ya! Throw in alot of rain, a zillion people rushing in every direction, most with umbrellas over their heads, and you get the picture. We just jumped in, and went with the flow, darting across streets, trying not to get run over by any cabs or buses. We really had no clue where we were going, but we managed to find a few things we wanted to see, like MTV, The Hard Rock Cafe, ESPN, you get the picture. The funny part of it was, that Hubbs was carrying my umbrella, a white one with pink and green tulips on it, and man he really stood out in the huge crowd! One guy on the street even made a comment about it! We were starved at this point, and without knowing where anything really was, we kinda were on the lookout for a place to eat. Problem was that every place was either filled, or had an hour or more wait, and we didn't have that kind of time to spare.

Especially mornings that I have to be awake earlier than usual. Like today, for instance. One of my caps fell out yesterday at work, (perfect timing!), so this morning I'm heading to the dentist to have it glued in.  Ugh.

In fact, I was so tired when I left work, I could barely drive home. This is ridiculous. I went to bed at 10:15, but I got up a bit ago, as I was craving an english muffin. I just finished the muffin, so I think I better head back to the sheets so I don't feel like \"shit on a stick\" again tomorrow. I love my folks to bits, but damn those people wear me out!!!

I took Mom and Dad out shopping after lunch today, and we hit a few more stores than originally planned. We started at Gabes, but not much was happening there, so we went in to my store for awhile, and I introduced them to a few of the \"crew\" there. They really enjoyed meeting them, even though my Mom bolted out the door, as she felt she wasn't dressed nice enuff to meet anyone. Don't ask. From there we went to TJ Maxx and browsed around a bit........not much interestiong there either, except they had some awesome coats there that I would love to have. Only problem is, they weren't very practical, but hey, I can't help it that I lean towards the funky sometimes! We left there and headed to Staples to see Nick, and let my Mom look for some organizer hickey that she wants. We saw Nick, but my Mom didn't find what she wanted so off we went to Target...............same scenario, but we left with a \"gourmet\" pretzel and an icee. Yum, they were good! We headed for home, voting to order pizza for dinner, instead of making something ourselves.  Mom and I made a nice salad, and before you knew it, the pizza was at the door. Eat, throw the plates in the dishwasher, and we're done. Love it! Well, back to the day flying by so fast..........I can't believe I go back to work on Wednesday. Damn. This week is gonna be a bit hectic, (in a good way), getting ready for our trip to New Jersey. I'm really excited, as we haven't been on a real trip for years, so this is going to be a good time. I can just feel it!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,October,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      As much as I love company, especially my folks, it wears me the hell out.

I was like, \"How friggin' cool is this?\" So being the middle-aged  kid that I am, I didn't read the Blog, I played with the skins! Entertaining to say the least. (Of course, everyone else out there probably knew about this stuff already) I'm a late bloomer when it comes to alot of these things!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,October,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      My Dad and Mom arrived safely around 4:30ish, and we sat around and chatted, catching up on my Dads trip down West Vrginia, and all kinds of stuff. I made a spaghetti dinner, which was so filling, I felt like I weighed a ton afterwards. I love pasta, but I hate how bloated it makes me feel afterwards. Anyway, after dinner, Jr. had to go to North East to pick up a part for his car, and he asked \"Pap\" to go along for the ride. Of course he said yes. Well, I was also in the mood to take \"Baby\" out for a little spin, so I grabbed my Mom, and off we went too. Just for a buzz around town though, but it was nice all the same. We just hung around the house watching T.V. the rest of the night, which was fine with me, as I was starting to get a bit sleepy. Right now, Hubbs is in bed and my Mom hit the sheets a few minutes ago too. Dad's watching T.V. and I guess it's obvious what I'm doing.  Anyway, I'm gonna hit the sheets soon myself. My peepers are tired. Shit, I'm tired all over........all the cleaning around here has just worn me out. NIck and Amanda went to Daves for one of his parties tonight. I hope they're having a nice time. Nite!

I told her \"of course\", then went back to bed. Shit, I hope that's all I said..........afterall, I was half asleep. Uh oh. I hope I wasn't a smartass.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,October,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I never thougt I'd hear myself say this, but I was kinda glad to go back to work today. No, I'm not losing my mind, but it was a nice break from cleaning the house, I must admit. I was beginning to get a bit edgy about me being the sole cleaning person around this place, and the more I cleaned, the more pissed off I was getting. So going back for awhile today, and gabbing with the \"crew\" was a good diversion. Kept me from kicking some asses around here! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,October,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I laid down for a nap around 2:30 yesterday afternoon, and I had one of those weird, vivd dreams that usually only happen to me if I sleep during the daytime. I was in this awesome house, my house, a house I've seen in my dreams before. The sucker is huge, with all kinds of whacky shit like a revolving living room, secret buttons everywhere that turn stereos and tv's on and off, just off the wall stuff everywhere. And the place is so huge, that you never seem to see the same rooms twice. Everything is crystal, velvet, silver.....just plain over the top. Well, after just getting into enjoying my new \" dream address\", I awake to find myself back in my little corner of the \"non-spinning livingroom\"  world, and I'm a bit pissed. Damn, I was enjoying that place.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>02,October,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, as of right now, at least two rooms in the house are less cluttered, and a bit more inhabitable. I also got the bed linens washed and put on, and next it's on to the dishes and folding clothes. My reward? A nice long hot shower before relaxing a bit, then bed. I'm pleased with my progress.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>02,October,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      A big \"Thank-You\" to  urlLink Amanda  for linking me on her page.

Yupper, I'm off today, and I'm enjoying it already, even though I've only been awake for a bit. There's a gazillion things I can get into around here, and where I will start is a mystery right now, but I need to get some major cleaning done  soon . I also need to get my Vettster ready to be put away for winter, *sigh*, and the New Yorker up to speed for Winter. There sure as hell is alot to do when you have two cars. No, I'm not complaining, I just never realized how many details need to be taken care of with this \"seasonal car\" stuff!  No problem though, I'm figuring it all out as I go, with  alot  of help from Hubbs. (And numerous paychecks!)   I think one of my missions is gonna be to throw out alot of stuff I have clutterung up my computer area, and put my Avon things here. This house is so small, that I don't have many options for an \"office area\" for my work. I think this area will will work well for that application. It has to......it's my only option!  Speaking of Avon, my order arrives tomorrow! Yeah! I always love order day because       it's such a blast to look through all the goodies that come! It's like Christmas. I know, I'm strange.

Holidayish. I bought two new Christmas music tapes today to add to my collection, and I can't wait to pop them in the stereo, and start Fa La La-ing right along with the music. We're kind of in a Thanksgiving limbo right now, as I don't know if we're going down to the 'Burgh, or if we're staying home. The weather forecast will determine where we eat the turkey! No matter what, a turkey will be enjoyed, wether here, in Pittsburgh or at Amandas house. Thanks for the invitation sweetie. That was so nice of you! :O)  I can't wait to get our tree and decorations up next week, and get started on our holiday shopping.

Self-confidence is  very  attractive! 3) Learn to like being alone with yourself.........you are your own best-friend. 4) Don't settle for bullshit........either make it better, or find better. Be it a job, a love, whatever. It's out there. It just takes time. 5) Happily ever-after does not mean being happy  every  fuckin' day. That's fantasy. Reality has happy times as well as rough times. 6) Getting through the rough times makes you stronger. It really does. 7) If the rough times  never  seem to  end,  you've got a major problem. Love finds solutions, and is willing to bend in order to mend. 8) Yes, you can have \"forever\" with someone. I do. 9) Life is a journey of growth and learning. If you're not learning and/or growing, you need to find out what's stopping you. 10) Most growth, be it  mental, spiritual, or in love, generally follows great struggle. 11) Life is a wonderful, mysterious, sometimes scary journey. Enjoy the trip and love every minute of being your wonderful self!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>21,November,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      The snowfall we had yesterday really put me into the holiday spirit.

It's hard to be pissed at a slow driver if you're listening to Frosty the Snowman!!) I think I'm gonna pull out the decorations the week after Thanksgiving, when I'll be off for three days and I can take my time. Sounds like a plan to me!   Work today was the usual drag, but I made it through, as usual. I had a nice surprise when I got home though. Hubbs and Nick went to Sears and bought us a new fridge! Awsome! Our old one was 21 years old......yikes! As long as we've been married. This one is pretty big compared to our old one, and I keep running into it, as I'm not used to it sticking out so far. Hopefully I'll get the hang of it before I'm covered in bruises! It even has an ice machine.........woohoo! Hey, it doesn't take much for me to get excited. Thanks guys for all you did to get this new one in and the old one out! Great job!!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>21,November,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Nick is home and asleep after getting his injection. Everything went fine, even though he was a bit anxious before and during the procedure. I was glad that they asked me to go in with him during the injection. I think it made both of us feel better.  He is schedueled for another one on December 16th, and I think for that one, I'm gonna give him a bit more sedative before hand, as the dose he took today didn't seem to calm him as much as he would have liked. Hopefully the shots will relieve his pain for him.....poor guy has suffered enuff already. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>18,November,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I want to put up a new skin on my blog, but am I ready for the mess that ensues?

And the sailors are smiling once again.......a welcome sight indeed. The journey of love is never-ending, and at times we all hit rough waters, sometimes falling over-board and nearly drowning in our tears. But if you hold on to tight to your heart-strings, dear Tenderhearts, your love for eachother will, more times than not, pull you through the storm. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>14,November,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Why do people with  foreign language blogs, put the titles in English?

After all is said and done, he walks over to us gals and states that a paper towel was the culprit of the clog, and it cost him $100.00 to fix it. Of course there's a big sign in the ladies room about this now. Furthermore, if this happens again, he's gonna have to shut down our bathroom. WTF. (Next thing you know, he's gonna lock the sucker up, and put the key on a big hunk of wood, like at a gas station, and make us as ask for permission to use it like a school kid.) This is beyond ludicrious. Then to top it all off, the woman who is our store decorator, and cleaning woman, starts bitching about how much toilet paper  we go thru in a week. Another WTF! I guess we'll have to start rationing paper next. We laughed so hard about this today, I thought I was gonna split my gut! This is just insane. These people  really  need to get a life. Hell, you can't even take a piss anymore without getting some kind of complex! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>11,November,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Today started out the usual way, with me thinking my \"this job sucks ass\" thoughts.Then all hell broke loose, and we were bombarded with frenzied customers for about 5 hours straight. No shit. We couldn't even go take a piss without someone tracking us down for help. Now don't get me wrong, this is a welcome change. But damn, it was a bit much. Luckily I had a few great sales that will hopefully bring me up to speed for the month. Even so, I'm having a martini tonight, partially in celebration for a great day of sales, and partially because my job still sucks ass. See, one great day does not a wonderful job make. It sure as hell feels great, but does not make up for the hundreds of f*cked up days. I need a career change. I have some options in mind. It won't be quick in coming, but everyday I need to keep my goals in sight, and I'll get there. I always do. I need more olives. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,November,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Shaken, stirred, I don't care! Just hurry up! I had an \"I hate my job\" day today. I have these alot, but today was bad. I mean I  really  zombied out on this shit today. I hated being in the building, hated my customers, hated my bosses, hated that we  still  have no heat, hated that I work on commission, hated that sales are down, and especially hated that there are others that seem so lucky, and I'm on the bottom of the sales \"shit list\" for more than a month now. These are the reasons that I'm drinking a double martini right now. It's either have a stiff drink, or burn down the building. I chose the drink, as I would not do well in prison. The outfits suck, and I never have been, nor will I ever be, somebodys bitch. Nuff said 'bout that. So here I sit, hating my job with a passion, but I do have some alternate plans in the works. Problem is, they're not a quick fix, (like I really would love), but some things to work towards, in order to get my frustrated ass outta the \"hell hole\" of retail sales. 'Till then, I guess I need to stock up on lots of 'tini fixins, as I think It's gonna be a bumpy ride kids. Have a nice evening!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>06,November,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      NIck must have enjoyed his birthday yesterday, as he thanked Hubbs, then me this morning.

I got our bedroom put back together, and I must say it looks wonderful! I also managed to get the guestroom polished up, as Mom and Dad arrive next Wednesday, and I wanted to be ready ahead of time. Now all I need to do tomorrow, is get all this crap out of my diningroom, and I'll be a happy gal indeed. Clean one room, trash three in the process........it never fails.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>05,November,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I was just leafing through my new December issue of Glamour magazine, when I came upon the \"Best and Worst of 2002\".

How  much  time doesn't matter. I have a few errands to run, then I need to wrap his goodies. Hubbs and I are taking him out to dinner, then home for cake and ice cream. It will just be a simple evening, with us , Amanda, and maybe a couple of his friends coming over too. I hope he has a happy day today. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>03,November,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, I guess today I get my \"I survived the teenage years\" badge for my Moms merit collection. It will proudly be displayed next to all the other numerous milestone memories, that have been collected along the way. In my mind, anyway. And I treasure each and every one of them. But most memorable, will always be the teenage years. Indeed.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>03,November,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Happy 20th Birthday Nick!

Scary part is, two of them passed about 4 feet in front of my bumper. Luckily I was driving slowly, anticipating that I might come across them. To tell you the truth, I'm not afraid of hitting a deer, but I  am  afraid of the friggin' air bag going off in my face if I do. Hitting the deer would probably just crunch my front end. The air bag would probably rip my head off. I fear the air bag. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>02,November,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Besides all the other crazy bullshit that went on around here last night, a friend of my son's was killed in a car accident. His name was Shawn. Now I didn't know this young man, but just hearing the news hit me in the pit of my stomach, and in my heart. It took me bact to two years ago this January, when my son Nick was in a horrendous car accident, that he survived only by a seatbelt and the Grace of God. I remember the call from my husband, and the tone of his voice. I remember when he told me that NIck was in an accident and it was bad, and mumbling the words \"is he alive?\" and praying the answer was yes. The answer was \"yes\". I knew I could handle  anything , as long as the answer was \"yes\". My heart aches tonight for a mother, father, siblings perhaps, and friends who didn't hear the answer \"yes\" when they asked the same question yesterday. I can't even imagine their pain. My thoughts and prayers go out to Shawns family and friends tonight, to give them strength through this time of loss and pain. My prayers go to Shawn, that he is in peace. Hug the ones you love a little tighter tonight. Say \"I love you\", just one more time. Smile, laugh, be silly, overlook the stupid things, embrace the \"now\", count your blessings,  live  everyday............because you never know. You just never know.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,November,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      This weekend I'm gonna give  urlLink HaloScan  a try as my commenting system, and see if they're less of a pain in the ass than Entination has been.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,November,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      This Enetation commenting system is starting to piss me off majorly. They're constantly off-line or doing some kind of upgrade crap, but the Pro version is never affected. Isn't that odd? Basically it's the old, give us some cashola and we won't mess with your shit. Well, just use the Tag Board for comments in the meantime, okay?\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>31,December,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      New Years Eve 2002!

I changed over to Haloscan commenting system, in hopes that they will have less issues than Enetation did. *fingers crossed* We'll see!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>29,December,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, I finally got this new skin up, but I still have a few kinks to work out. I also fixed the comments problem, although for the life of me, I don't know what happened there. Oh well, who gives a shit anyway. I sure as hell don't, so I most certainly don't expect you to.   Today was an uneventful day, just like I hoped it would be. I love the days following the holidays, when you can just unwind and put all the hustle and bustle (and stress!) behind, and just look at all the great gifts you got, and enjoy it all. Personally, I'm enjoying all the edible goodies around here at the moment, because starting January 1st, it's back to watching the snacking and junk food again. I lost a few pounds before I had my surgery, and it felt  so  good. But after the surgery, I was able to eat normally again, and I put a couple back on, so I want to get back on track before it all creeps up on me again. And it happens fast if you're not careful. So, beginning the new year, I'm watching what and when I eat, and hitting the floor on my new exercise mat, ( thanks again Amanda!), to work those neglected abs. Neglected for like, um let me see...........   20 freakin' years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Can you tell I don't quite enjoy ab work-outs? Well, I promised myself a belly piercing if I can get my tummy to the point where I can flash it a tad bit. Now not like Britney or anything. Just a glimmer, a little bit.....a sneak peek. I'd be happy with that. Indeed! Wish me luck. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,December,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      The word comments has mysteriously changed to poseurs.

We had a crazy day of visiting, but enjoyed each stop to the fullest! It really was fun, even though we we're growing pretty weary by evening. The ride home was very long, slow, and nerve wracking, as we drove through an ice storm, then snow. It seemed like we would never get here. Sheesh! We saw cars flipped over, and some that had just slid off the road. I'm  really  glad to be home safe and sound. Thank goodness Hubbs is such a wonderful driver! Well, another year that we wished eachother \"Merry Christmas\" while on the good old interstate! Santa comes soon, so I gotta head to bed. Goodnight all!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>24,December,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well folks, it's here. Christmas Eve Day. I hope you have all your gifts bought and wrapped, and all the little (and big) details finalized, cause guess what.......you're runnin' out of time if you haven't! I ran around all day and finally got everything under control.....or at least make it appear to be. Lol. We're off to visit family today, in an all day holiday \"blitz\", (we'll miss you Amamda!), then back home late tonight, so we can be home in the morning and enjoy a lazy Christmas Day. Sounds great to me after all the hustle and bustle that's been going on the past few weeks. I'm making a turkey tomorrow, but nothing elaborate. Like I said, the emphasis is on lazy! Hmmm, I wonder what Santa is gonna bring me this year? My list was rather sparse, so this should be interesting. If I get what I asked for, I'll get a Colgate Spinbrush Pro, a sideview mirror for the \"Vette and a turntable for the microwave. I hope I get the mirror! Well, I better fly off to dreamland, as It's going to be a busy day tomorrow and we are getting up pretty early. Oh, and Amanda. Hurry back. I miss you! Night all.....sweet dreams. You know....sugarplums and such! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>17,December,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Today was a productive day, to say the least. I got my guest-room cleaned out, and all the christmas boxes into the shed, washed my bed linens, did other laundry too, mopped the kitchen floor, shampooed the living room carpet, cleaned the clutter off the kitchen counter, finished decorating the house, made some calls, wrote out a few more Christmas cards, and did some last minute online shopping! Whew! Oh yeah.......I did my nails too! Did I ever tell you how much I  love  online shopping? I don't do it  all  that much, but I'll tell ya, at holiday time, it sure is a time saver and sometimes a life saver if you're short on time but need that gift quick! It's saving my ass big time this year. I just don't have the time to drive around from store to store and hope they have what I need. I don't think anyone does anymore, quite frankly. Well, I'm beat after my long day, and I have an even longer day at \"the Grind\" tomorrow, so for now....... night, night! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>11,December,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I haven't been bloggong in awhile, as I've either been working, or frantically trying to get ready for Christmas. I shopped at Wal Mart for about 4 hours on Sunday night, and got all but a few gifts. This made me feel alot better, as before my shopping trip, I had no gifts purchased. None. Nada. I was freakin' out about it. Bad. Now we only have to figure out what we're getting my parents, and Hubbys mom. It's a bitch, because they have so much stuff already. I dunno what we'll come up with, but damn it, we have a fast approaching deadline here. Think, think, think. Nuthin'. Shit. Other than that, things are rolling right along. I got a few more decorations up today, and the way I figure it, if it doesn'tn get put out......oh well. No one will notice but me anyway. Trust me. Well, i'm gonna hit the sack soon, one more day off and I have alot to get done tomorrow. Nitey night!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>11,December,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, yesterday I had my annual \"holiday meltdown\". It's like all the details of what I need to get done in the next couple of weeks, like shop, wrap, finish decorating, laundry, bills, not enuff time...... start swirling around in my head, like one of those spin pictures you make at the fair, till I feel like I'm having a friggin' anxiety attack. I think I do actually have an anxiety attack. Sleep is my only savior. So I crashed out early, and the good news is, today was a much better day. I was focused, and not anxious at all. I got the tree decorated, made plans with hubby to go shopping on Sunday, and had a good day in general. I know that when I finally but some gifts, I'll feel alot better, but the fear of not finding the gifts I want makes me nuts. Another problem is,  I don't know  exactly what I want to get. Great, another crisis looms. Just kidding. Sometimes I get so caught up in the holiday hustle, that I forget what's most important. Enjoying it. I'll have to keep reminding myself of that on a regular basis.

Nothing particular happened to make it terrible, it just sucked in general. My attitude toward my job has been spiraling downward faster and faster as time goes by. It used to be weeks between my frustrating times........now it's days between. Sometimes one day. Today I felt so stressed, I just wanted to run out the door. This shit sucks big time. I really need to find a job that I feel fulfilled doing, not this shit where I count the hours 'till quitting time, leave stressed and dread going in the next day. There has to be more to a job than this. This is friggin' torture. Goodnight.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,December,2002</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I had a fabulously wonderful day today............doing something I wanted to do, instead of doing things I should do. Like boring hosehold stuff. Sometimes the practical Capricorn side of me keeps me from having fun. Today I wasn't about to let that happen, and I'm so glad didn't! Amanda and I went out gown shopping together, for a wedding she's in this coming January. I had a  great  time, and I believe she did too. And the best thing was that she found a gorgeous gown, that she just loves and looks adorable in, in no time at all!! Wow! Actually it was the first one she tried on, and that was that. It looked perfect, except for possibly needing hemmed and the straps altered a bit. That's it! Amazing. We headed to the mall, and she found cute shoes in Penneys. All she needs is to figure out the jewelry and a bag. I can't wait to see how she looks on the day of the wedding. I think she'll look like a Winter Princess. *smiles*    Well, as much as I hate to, I must head off to bed now, as it's back to the \"grind\" tomorrow, and I don't want to be draggin' my ass all day. Ugh, going back is always  rough after 3 days of being at home. But at least I return knowing that I got a few things on my \"to do\" list taken care of. I got the Christmas decorations started, the hamster cages cleaned, and my Avon books delivered. In the next couple weeks, I need to decorate the tree, write and send out the Christmas cards, go shopping, and figure out what the hell I want for Christmas besides a Colgate Spinbrush Pro. Honestly, that's all I can think that I want. *shrugs shoulders* Nitey night snow babies.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>30,January,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Note to self: When going To Wal Mart,  do not  pop into Fashion Bug to \" browse \".

You swap your stuff for someone elses stuff. Pretty cool idea. Only problem I may have, is that I don't want to get rid of any of my stuff. I want new stuff, yesindeedee, but I can't seem to give up any old stuff to get it. I think I'm in a Swappingtons limbo here. Go figure.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,January,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I slept until 11:30 today, and I have to say it felt wonderful. No guilt.......I deserved it. I busted ass all day today, and got everything accomplished that I set out to do. Yes, the Christmas stuff is down, and neatly tucked away in boxes that are patiently waiting to be transported to the shed tomorrow. Amen. I couldn't bear to look at it one more day.     The hassles at work are still the same. The meeting with the District Manager went well, but I don't know if any real concrete results will ensue from it. I guess only time will tell. Meantime, I'm still sucking ass in sales this month, and only a true miracle from God can save me at this point. But I decided not to stress about it, just get through the days, and let the chips fall where they may. If I get canned, I'll find something else, after collecting unemployment all Summer. No biggie. It just pisses me off though, because I'm not making any money right now. Well, I better hit the sheets. Long day tomorrow, and it's only longer if I'm draggin' my ass all day! goodnight.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,January,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Has it been almost a week since I last graced my Blog pages with useless, rambling bullshit? Sheesh, I guess so! How time flys when your tired as a dead dog and gagging on gross cough meds, just so you can try to eek out perhaps a couple hours of sleep at night. Get the picture? I been feelin' like shit lately, and just haven't been up to sharing my precious thoughts. Well, here I am, feeling better, but not quite full throttle just yet. I think tonight is \"clean house night\" for my hamsters. I have become a slum-lord, and they're starting to give me dirty little hamster looks. That, or I've just taken too damn cold meds over the past two weeks. Nah, they're lookin' at me funny. So I better get my ass in gear and spruce up the little critters abodes.........pronto.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>16,January,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      After choking back my morning dose of cough syrup, the thought occurred to me. Why can't anyone make a decent tasting cough medicine for adults? I mean, they make all kind of flavored stuff for kids, don't they? Maybe I should try a bottle of their cough meds, although I'd probably have to down half a bottle to get the same effect.  I guess I'm stuck with the nasty tasting shit I have. This stuff could gag a maggot. Ugh.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>15,January,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      The meeting with the District Jackass, oops, I mean Manager was cancelled due to snow. Not that I want to drive to a meeting when we got about a foot of snow today, but it figures that just when we get the chance to voice our opinions, a friggin' snowstorm blows in and we get put on hold. Figures.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>14,January,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      It was pure suckage at work today. And yesterday too......yeah I might as well throw that in since we're on the subject. We're all trying to keep eachother up-beat and motivated, but it's so hard when business is slower than it's ever been, and our jobs are threatened if we don't meet the quotas. I'm not gonna lie. We're frustrated, scared, and pissed off. Mostly pissed off. And each day just seems to get worse. Thursday morning, we are meeting with one of the corporate guys, our  elusive  District Manager, to discuss our grievences. This outta be good. The district Managers are the assholes who thought up all this quota bullshit. Hell, he isn't going to back down. His job is secure, no matter how many of us sales people go down the tubes. The only positive thing is, that at least we're going to have a chance to have our say, even if it doesn't get us anywhere. I guess I'll know more after Thursday. On a brighter note, I'm off for two days! Tomorrow is R&R day. I think I'll try to get the Christmas stuff put away on Thursday. Sounds like a plan to me!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>11,January,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I'm bummed my Steelers lost today, but it was one hell of good game, I'll tell ya.

And the couple of days I had off, I've spent visiting with my parents, who are staying with us for a few days. Nothing new anyway. Same old shit. I have to get a good nights sleep tonight, as all the running around and staying up late are catching up to me today. Hopefully, I'll be feeling good as new in a day or two, and I can get back to my usual smart-ass ways.

I dunno. It baffles me. As they sit pondering their direction in this life; it's meaning and purpose; why life is as it is; where they should be; where they want to be; where they could be; where they've been; why they've been there; who they've been with and why; who they should be with and why; why they're wonderful; why they're not and so forth and so on. Hell, I have a friggin' migrane just reading this stuff. No wonder they're stressed..............they think too goddamn much! Meanwhile, life is passing them by, while they think about it................instead of just enjoying the ride and living it! I mean, it's a good thing to think about your future, and learn from past mistakes. But hell, don't spend every waking moment trying to understand the mysteries of life. If we were able to figure them out, they wouldn't be mysteries now would they? Go out, have a great time, take the good with the bad, and spread around as much love and compassion as you can, every day. Everything else will fall into place, wether you think about it or not. Don't think about life. Live it and love it!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>05,January,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      As planned, I did take the day off, and so far it's been going well in the cleaning department. I always dread making \"the call\", but after I do, all is well! It's snowing lightly, so Nick is anticipating a good day of snowboarding at the Peek. He'll be leaving shortly, so that leaves me alone to conquer the dust in the castle. I really hope he has a good time today, as the last few times he's gone, the conditions were shitty. Well, I'm off to continue my work. Have a wonderful day snowbabies!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>05,January,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I had a  wonderful  birthday today, (even though my best-friend forgot about it), just spending the day at home with my honey. I slept in, and he brought me coffee to start my day, along with  lots  of \"Happy Birthday\" wishes. Then we watched the game together, which was a real \"nail biter\" to say the least! As I stated in my last post, the Steelers did win in a  tense  final 5 minutes of the game. All I can say is that praying does work, as I did alot of that during those final minutes!  Then Hubbs grilled me (us) a wonderful steak dinner, which was yummy. After dinner, he brought in a beautiful birthday cake, ablaze with candles, singing Happy Birthday to me, as he carried the cake. It was very pretty with chocolate icing and red roses (for love). He brought me gifts, one at a time.............a new wash mit for the 'Vette.........a CD tower for my PC...........an optical mouse.........a new mouse pad............and a CD changer for the 'Vette........and last but not least, a really awesome card! I loved every bit of my day, spent the way I wanted, with my family. My brother Mike called and so did my parents, also adding to my days joy. Now the only thing is, do I call in sick tomorrow? See, my folks are due to come up on Tuesday afternoon and I work thru Tuesday night. This scenerio leaves me only tomorrow night after 9:30 PM to clean up around here. Hmmmm. It would be much less stressful if I cleaned tomorrow, and worked Tuesday, then Wednesday and Thursday off, to visit with my folks............rested and relaxed. I'm convinced. I'm blowing off tomorrow, for my sanitys sake.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>03,January,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n        Steelers pull off win over the \"Brownies\"!

And for  good  reason this time. Shit hit the fan at our Friday sales meeting, as we found out that the corporation has  again  raised our sales expectations.  Bad enough in and of itself, made even worse by low sales the past few months. A couple of the guys were trying to figure out how long it will be untill all of us are gone. June? Maybe July? I came home frazzled to the core. I realize I have to come up with a plan \"B\" should I get the \"boot\". Good news is, if I do get fired over quotas, I can at least collect unemployment for awhile. Bad news is...........no benefits. I need to line up my ducks in a hurry. Man this sucks. Sometimes I honestly believe that good guys finish last.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,January,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I am tired. Not just regular tired, but super- duper, supersized tired. It was a long day at work today, 9 to 9, and one of my co-workers bitched and moaned about everything under the sun, all friggin' day. This made a long day seem twice as long. If he does it again tomorrow, I'm taking him out into the parking lot, and slapping the shit out of him. Really. In my last post I mentioned being more compassionate this year. Well, I tried that with this fella most of the day today, but compassion wore thin around 6 P.M. Sorry, that's the reality of it. Anyway, give me a break.......it's only January the 2nd. You honestly can't expect me to be a pro at it already, can ya? Plus, I didn't think I'd be tested so soon. Gotta hit the sheets now......................I'm fading fast! Nitey night sweet dreamers.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,January,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I was sitting here trying to figure out what my one New Years resolution was going to be this year. I used to make a whole shitlist of resolutions, but found it hard to keep,  hell even remember , any of them. So I decided to pick one thing each year that I could  really  concentrate on changing. Improving. I think this year it's gonna be in the compassion department. I feel I need a bit of work in being more compassionate towards others. Now, I don't feel that I totally suck in this area, but I do feel like I could hone it a bit, and get a bit deeper. Yeah that's it! This year I'm going to work on being a more loving and compassionate person.

Other than that, it was a nice, cozy evening at home , watching movies, (Triple X and Barbershop), with Hubbs, Nick and Amanda. Hubbs dozed off around 11, as usual, but awoke in time for our New Years toast. I'm headed to dreamland any second here, as I work tomorrow morning and dragging my ass all day isn't the way I want to start 2003. Night all, and I hope this year holds only the best for you!

Especially when it didn't have to happen. That band shouldn't have had pyro shit in a small club like that, with flammable materials all around them. And it's not as if they were a new band or something, with no experience. They've been around for a long time, with lots of venues in the past. Where were they're heads? Too late now. Lots of empty beds tonight, where feisty young people should be sleeping, dreaming about what a wonderful time they had last night. But they're not there tonight. I can't even imagine the pain of the families and friends.. I think I'm gonna go give my son an extra big hug tonight.

I didn't make it through the whole tape, and I only did half of the sets they did, but I broke a pretty good sweat, and called it quits when I knew I had enough. Not too bad  for one who hasn't worked out in about 20 years or so. I did enjoy the workout, and I feel it will keep my interest for a long time. I plan to do basic mat exercises along with the Tae Bo as a change of pace. Phew............gotta hit the shower.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>10,February,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I really got alot done today, which was a nice surprise, considering that I had originally planned on sitting on my ass all day, and doing nuthin'! I went to Wal Mart and had my oil changed in the New Yorker, and did a bit of cosmetic shopping. Yeah, even though I sell Avon, and I primarily buy their stuff, I like to try new stuff by other brands too. I left there, and went to Hallmark to pick up a couple of birthday cards and a few Valentines. From there, I delivered a couple of orders, then headed home to make chili for dinner, and do laundry, clean up the kitchen, write out bills...................and now that all that's done, I'm relaxing! I joined Ebay the other day, and I currently have a bid in for a chrome air cleaner lid for the Vette. I think it will look sharp, adding a bit of chrome under the hood, and the price was right, so it's an inexpensive addition to boot. I gotta think thrifty, as I want to have plenty of cash for the necessities............like gas. And at the rate the prices are going, it's gonna cost a friggin' fortune  to cruise this summer. Hopefully prices will drop drastically by then. *crosses fingers*    I also checked out the beginners Tae Bo tape today, and all I have to say is that it's either gonna whip my ass into fantastic shape, or...........kill me. There's no grey area here. I mean, Billy Blanks is sweating like a pig, and he's in fantastic shape. I really hope I don't die. If I do croak, please lay me out in a crop top to show off the great abs I (hopefully) have. I mean, that's what this was all about, and I don't want to go to the grave without anyone seeing them. Thanks in advance.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>09,February,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I'm really excited about starting Tae bo workouts. I believe this will be one exercise plan that will not only work, but will keep me interested and motivated. I loved it when Hubbs and I took martial arts classes together in our twenties, and being that this is very similar, I think I'll like it alot. Once I get past the initial aches and pains of beginning a new workout, I'll be fine.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,February,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, I haven't posted in awhile, because I've been pretty busy working, and really haven't had much to say. Work has been going great this week. In fact everything has been great lately. I'm almost afraid if I talk about how wonderful things are, I'll jinx myself. Nah......I really don't believe in that shit. Lately I've been feeling on top of the world........at work, at home, in my head, body and spirit. It's like everything is working perfectly and at peak performance. I love this shit! It feel so wonderful to be in charge of things for a change, like finally alot of things are going my way. I have three glorious days off ahead, and I plan to enjoy them to the fullest!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,February,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Hubbs arrived home safely tonight around 8ish. This was a surprise to me, as they weren't supposed to get in till tomorrow night. Oh well, it's nice to have him home again, and I did get the house all spiffed up before he arrived, which was great. I feel much better now, knowing I got all the much neglected cleaning done around this place. Phew I busted ass today, as I was full of energy unlike any I've seen in a long time! Must be the vitamins I've been taking! Well, all the activities today have worn me out, so I think I'm going to get some much needed rest. Long day tomorrow, and I want to be on my toes, ya know. Nite.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,February,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      While Hubbs is in North Carolina golfing with his brother Ron, I have been enjoying a few days of \"me time\".  I love it, and the bit of freedom it gives me. It's not that I'm even doing anything special, but for a few days I can do what I want, when I want, and his schedual isn't involved. It's just a nice break from the norm. I do miss him alot though. We are together all the time, pretty much the story since we met 26 years ago. So when he is gone, there's a void, that even though I enjoy in small doses, I could not handle being apart from him for a long period of time. It's nice having someone to love, and love you back. Indeed.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,February,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Here's another interesting search entry that brought someone to my site........\"Do trees sleep at a regular time\"?

Yikes.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>19,March,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Once again, a search of \"Do trees sleep?\" brought someone to my site. If this were  even  an option, one would asume that trees also have an awake time. Are some trees morning trees? Really perky in the A.M.?   Maybe some are night owls, or should I say 'night trees\", that stay up reeeeeealy late, and then sleep in 'till noon. Hold on a minute...I'm gonna sneak outside and scare the shit out of my sleeping trees! *rolls eyes*  Idiots. I wonder if the full moon has anything to do with this? \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>17,March,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Nick and Amanda arrived safley home around 6:30am Saturday.

I am going absolutely, freakin' nuts without my car. Nick and his buddy Joel were out in the driveway today working on their cars, and it only seemed to add to my frustration. I know that it's only been away for 5 months, and I do get to drive it for 7, but waiting for 15 more days just seems like an eternity right now. I just can't stand it.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>11,March,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I am having an absolute  blast  pet sitting Amanda's 2 ferretts! These guys are entertaining as pets come. I let them out to run around at least three times a day, and they romp around like little clowns, wrestle eachother, play hide and seek, then crash out after having a snack. Too cute! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,March,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Only 10 days until the first day of Spring!!!

This is gonna be fun! They are just  too  adorable and funny. I luv 'em to pieces. Thanks Amanda, for letting me care for your little ones for awhile. I'll take  very  good care of them,  promise .\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,March,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Man, it's gonna be a bitch getting back in the groove at work tomorrow. Three days off, although I do love 'em, are hard to recover from in regards to work. Tomorrow, I'll be lethargic, to say the least. On Thursday, I'll be right back to my usual \"killer\" self.   Today was a nice day, just getting stuff done around the house. Nothing specific.The only thing that pissed me off, was that one of my Avon customers woke me up with an order this morning, and I really needed/wanted to sleep in. And to boot, the orders were due in by Sunday. I swear these people can't read. Well anyway, I stayed up, did my work-outs and proceded along with laundry, etc. You know, fun shit.    In other news, Nick and Amanda are leaving for Coco (sp?) Beach on Friday for Spring Break . Nice! I know they'll have a wonderful time. That is if my son ever gets his shit packed and ready! Sheesh. I've never been there, but it's really beautiful.....at least in the photos I've seen. I also hope they have good traveling weather, as this time of year it's so unpredictable. I wish I was going, but Nicks car doesn't have a trunk, so stowing away just isn't an option. That, and the last people they want to see there are parents. Can't blame 'em!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,March,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I have been so busy counting the days untill I get my car out of storage, that I haven't been noticing how nice and enjoyable it is to drive my \"winter car\". Relaxing, actually. It seems I've forgotten the mild  paranoia  that accompanies driving a \"classic car\", and the work that goes along with it too. Like detailing it every day, all summer.  Every day . I seemed to forget about the worry of someone scratching it while it's parked in a lot somewhere, or some asshole smashing into it on the street. I forgot about peeking out the window all day while at work, to make sure no one's screwing around with it. Now don't get me wrong, I love my Vette, and it's a blast to own and drive, but there's a price to pay also. So I figure I'm just going to enjoy driving my winter ride while I can. It's already scratched, so if someone dings it, hell I won't even notice. I hope no one smashes into it, but if they do, it will piss me off to have the air bag smack me in the face. I haven't washed it all winter, (except for when Hubbs ran it through a car wash a week ago), and it doesn't look bad dirty. All my winter ride wants is a tank of gas, an oil change and washer fluid. That's it. Get in and go. And no need to peek out the window. Not even once!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,March,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Goodbye February.........hello March!  Finally, it seems we're making some seasonal progress here!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>08,April,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, after three fabulous days off, (despite the shitty weather), I head back to work tomorrow. My New Yorker started having tranny issues last week, which have yet to be resolved, so I've been driving the \"beater truck\" as my back-up. The thing looks like hell, but it has a heater, a radio, and gets me where the hell I have to go, so I'm not complaining. Hopefully, the weather will improve enuff that I'll be able to take the Vette when I want to. Not too much has been happening around here lately.......................hence the lack of posts. I have been spending alot of time on ebay, or too much time as my son informs me. Can't help it. I can shop and never leave the house to do it. This is pure fuckin' nirvana to me! Well, I better hit the sheets. Long day tomorow, back with the old crew after switching teams for a month. Should be interesting. Night.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,April,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Amanda took \"The Boys\" home last night. I miss 'em. They were alot of fun while they were here, and I looked forward to letting them out to play each day. We did have a blast!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,April,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I'm back! As you can see I've been \"tinkering\" a bit around here. I've been wanting to change the colors for awhile now, but just wasn't in the mood to piss around with it. I also wrote a couple of entries a few days ago, but my computer decided to vanquish them to some unknown void, so I said f**k it, and didn't re-write them. Again, I wasn't in the mood. I do things by the mood I'm in at the moment, in case you haven't already noticed that. I've really been spending most of my time on Ebay, buying stuff I really want, as March was a good month at work, and I probably won't have the funds I do now again,  'till the end of the year. So I'm buying now. And I'm lovin' it. Ebay is my new addiction. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>15,May,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, I've made it back after a bit of a Blog \"layoff', so to speak. I just got tired of writing the same old shit. It will probably be the same old shit again, but what can I say? My life just isn't that damn interesting. Now, if I would have had this stuff around like, 25 years ago, well you'd have been  glued  to my writings! And I would have been in deep shit, I'm sure. So it probably works out for the best that I didn't have this in my younger years. Nuff said about that!   Last night, was one of the nicest times I've had in a long time. My son invited me to join him and his friends when they went on a group cruise. I said yes  instantly , as normally I drive around alone, and the thought of riding around with some other people sounded wonderful! And luckily it was on a night that I wasn't working. We basically drove to MacDonalds on  State Street, as that was the determined meeting spot. We waited around for about an hour till everyone arrived, then stood around and bullshitted awhile, and took photos and video. I felt a bit odd at first, but after awhile, I felt very welcomed and included. We left there, and drove 2 by 2 up State to Peach Street, around Tinsletown Cinema, then over to Brusters and parked in their lot for awhile. Damn, I froze my ass off there, but it was nice just talking and watching  a few of them toss frisbee around. We headed up Peach to Country Fair on a bathroom run, and got coffee and snacks, then back down to State Street, around the dock and over to the Park & Ride to park and hang out some more. From there we went up to 26th street to the Sheetz to get some real food, and sat in the lot till 2:30A.M.. I was dead tired by the time I got home, but I had such a great time that I didn't care. Nicks friends are  just such good people. I wish the people that trash talk youth could see what I saw. What I know, and  have known  for a  long  time. The assholes are  the  minority . Most of todays pierced, tattooed, crazy haired, bass thumping, import driving youth are wonderful people, just trying to express themselves. Hell they should, that's what youth's all about! They'll have they're fuckin' golden years to be bland and boring, damn it. Who the hell needs that shit? Anyway, these guys all have jobs, and pride, and manners. I had a terrific time, and I want to thank all of them for including me in their evening, and treating me like a friend,( who they all call Mom)! I love it and wouldn't want it any other way. P.S.- Thanks for the invite Nick! \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>30,June,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I love my son's sense of humor. (sometimes) Yesterday, I told him that today was my 4 year anniversary at work. His reply? \"I'm so sorry\".  I love it! I almost died laughing!  \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>28,June,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Jr. came home awhile ago after a looooong day at work, and I swear I have  never  seen that guy so friggin' dirty!

Beautiful warm weather, starry sky, cruising in the Vettester with Hubby with the t-tops off, hitting the highway, then a nice drive-by thru Geneva on the Lake.  Just perfect. (Except for getting the bugs off the windshield and front grille! Lol!) \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>20,June,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, I got my car backk yesterday, after 4 loooonnnnnggggg days apart, and even though I'm thrilled to have her back home, I'm really pissed about a few things. First of all, I was damn mad when I drove by the shop on the second day, and saw her sitting outside overnight! Now, I really thought this guy would have more sense than to leave her outside all night. No alarm, all my papers in the car, sitting out front of the building, all night. Asshole. I was upset.  When I mentioned it to Hubby, he said \"Didn't you ask him if he was going to put it inside?\" Men.  Then I go and pick her up yesterday, and she's covered in rain spots, mud on the tires, mud on my drivers floor mat. WTF? I pay, and drive her home, where I have to give her a complete detail job, and I discover that not only are there tiny bubble spots in the clearcoat on the door, but the whole fuckin' front end of the car is covered in overspray!!! Now, Hubby just buffed out the whole car about three weeks ago, so feeling the overspray when I was drying her was easy to do. Damn it. Double damn it.  I'm pissed! I'm sure he'll offer to take care of everything for me, but shit, then I'll lose even more driving days because of someone elses  incompetence. I had told him that when I have my whole car painted, I would like him to do it. Screw that. I can't wait to have a little talk with him today. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>18,June,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I finally get my car back tomorrow, after 4  long  days. Damn I miss my car! I stopped by the shop today, and Tom told me that she'd be ready before noon tomorrow. Great! In case I didn't mention , some asshole hit the drivers door on my Vette with their door, and boogied, leaving a one inch circle of missing paint. Man was I pissed! Especially since I park a freakin' mile away from the stores. No matter what, someone has park right next to me. Anyway, I'll be glad to have her back home again. The weather is finally getting nice and warm, and the rain seems to be going away, so it's time to do some cruising, eh? That's all I can do, as I sure as hell am afraid to stop and park! Kidding. (Thank goodness for comprehensive coverage!)\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>12,June,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Finally,  this Blog stuff is working. For the past few days, there have been problems here where as I couldn't post due to some freakin' errors. I don't know what it was. I normally don't have a helluva lot to say, but then when I do, this damn thing is acting up. I shouldn't bitch though, it is free after all.    Today was a nice day off. Nothing great happened, but it was one of those days where you just feel at ease and relaxed. I got a bit accomplished around the house, with plans on finishing tomorrow after I shop for food. My brother in law will be over here on Saturday, so I'm using that as a reason to get my ass in gear and clean. He won't notice a damn thing, but that's fine with me. I'm just using his visit as pure, selfish motivation. Hell, somethin' gotta move this lazy ass of mine, as I've been putting this stuff off forever. Oh well, I've started, it looks good so far, and that's that.  I went to Target today to get a shower gift for my nephew 's bride-to-be, and I had such a good time looking at all their neat-o stuff along my shopping route. Naturally, after I found their gift, I  had  to pick up a , (well actually a few), tid bits for moi. I found some Lemongrass poutpourri, oil, and incense that I just had to have! HAD TO! I love Lemongrass scent, but never see it anwhere, so I grabbed it when I saw it! I also bought incense called Coastal Mist, that is very nice also. Hmmmmmm. I'll have to go back and get the matching poutpourri now that I'm thinking about it. Best of all, it was marked down!!!! I must admit, I'm one hell of a bargain shopper. Yes I am. (I pride myself on this kinda shit. My world is small. Gimme a break.)\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>12,June,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      First of all, it's  still  raining. Storming actually. I don't know if I should go to bed, or start building a friggin' ark. I hate this weather. All in all today wasn't too bad, considering it started off with a 9am bullshit meeting at work. Good news is, we don't have a sales meeting tomorrow morning, so it's kind of a wash out. I came home and took a 2 hour nap (fabulous!), then did some laundry, polished my nails, took out the trash, and watched a bit of TV in between. Nothing exciting, but no one was home all day, so I really had time to myself, to re-group a bit before heading back to work tomorrow. Just going in there today made me realize just how badly I have to get the hell out. It suffocates me after only a few minutes.  So it's off to the grind tomorrow, with my 5 days off, just a memory. Man they went by too fast! Sheesh.   I hope my jacket comes tomorrow, and I really hope it fits. That's the only thing about Ebay. You have to go by someones description and measurements, and hope they're correct. I just love this jacket, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed that all will be okay with it. Best part is, it retails new for over $400.00, but I got it for $39.00. Is that great or what? I just love my Ebay!   Well, Hubby should be pulling in any minute, my tanning shit is dry, so I think I'm gonna head off to dreamland. Nite!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>11,June,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of my new leather jacket that I won on Ebay.  Right now it's in Utah.  Great.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>11,June,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I am bored out of my friggin' skull.  I want a new job. Just to do something new, sounds so exciting to me right now. I am looking forward to visiting my brother in a few weeks. The thought of a road trip, and being in a new place for a couple of days, sounds great.  Boredom sucks.  It feel like winter in reverse.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>11,June,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, as you can see, I've been re-arranging the rooms again! My house looks like shit, but my blog looks good......go figure. I've had 4 days off so far, with one more to go, and I have  no  motivation whatsoever. None. Zip. Of coure maybe it's the fact that I have people around here most of the day, so I find it hard to dig into a project when I'm being asked questions all day. So all my good intentions of getting things accomplished around the house this week, have all been flushed down the shitter. And I can't even go for a relaxing cruise, as it's  still  raining out. Damn it, will it ever stop raining? I just can't stand it any longer. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>05,June,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      It is raining  again  today. WTF. I swear, I have never seen such a lousy Spring in my life. This shit is down right depressing already. I could just scream!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,June,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Better late than never........\"Happy 2 1/2 year Anniversary, Nick & Amanda!\"  Love you both.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,June,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, so far today has been less then interesting, but just the fact that I'm off work makes me giddy. Tomorrow is going to be busy, as I have a 9am meeting at work (assholes), then it's grocery time again, and errands around town to wrap it all up. Hubby's birthday is on Sunday, so I have  alot  of loose ends to tie up where that's concerned.   Today was an odd day. I went along in a kind of haze, just floating throught the hours. Now looking back on it, it's like \"Where the hell did the day go?\" Sometimes I can be so damn strange.  (I think living with a Gemini and a Scorpio has something to do with my neurosis) Just a thought.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,July,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Nirvana. I'm home from work early, no one is home, and I can do whatever I want for the rest of the evening. Now the question is......do I take a nap, go for a cruise or what?  Hmmmmmm. Maybe a bit of each.  I finally figured out how to get a graphic onto my page! Now I don't know how to move it to other places or anything fancy, but trust me, just getting the damn thing onto my page is a  huge  acomplishment for  me ! Huge. If I get a background to work, I'll probably shit myself with delight! Unless you're Amanda, you have no idea what an ordeal these things are, for a html retard like me.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>21,July,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n        Congratulations Nick!!    Hubbs and I drove out to the car show at Enormis on Saturday night, and personally, I had a great time. Nick placing third in his class, and taking home a nice trophy, left me riding home with a big smile on my face! I was really hoping he'd take something home, the kid works so hard on the car, and lord knows he doesn't have alot of cash to work with. There were alot of awesome cars there, so I didn't know how  things would turn out for him. When they announced his name, Amanda and I just  screamed ! This other gal did too, but hell if I can remember her name. She's a sweet person, but my memory just sucks when it comes to names. Anyway, the  three of us screamed and clapped.....loudly! WooooHooo!  This was the first time I had ever been to an Import show, and I must say those cars are really something to see! And when it got dark, and all the neon light came on, it looked like a freakin'n carnival! It was great! (even if my other half acted like a \"fud-dud\"!)\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>05,July,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Booze and Bouncing!   Nice relaxing day at home today. Nick  fiddled with my car a bit, getting it ready for my trip tomorrow. Got it washed just before the thunder storm rolled in! Then Amanda and Nick arrived, and Amanda made some yummy drinks in her blender.  After a couple of drinks, I got on the damn trampoline, and laughed like a friggin' idiot for the longest time. It really was fun, although I don't think I could do it on a regular basis. Unless of course Amanda shows up with her blender on a regular basis.  Just a thought. We all sat on our street tonight and watched the fireworks, which was a nice ending to a great day. I'll talk to ya when I get back from my road trip on Monday. See ya!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>04,July,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n        Happy 4th Everyone!  Everythings cool, gonna enjoy the day. Hope you enjoy it too!

I don't know if it's some bad cosmic vibe or what, but the tension is so thick you can cut it whth a knife. I personally am not a contributor to the bad vibe, but a recipiant of the bullshit.  As usual. And I'm pisses about it, and I need to vent, even if it is into cyberfuckinspace. I am tired of being on the receiving end of peoples messed up lives. See, I try to be a patient, understanding person, going through life trying to make the least amount of waves for people that I possibly can. I try my best to be upbeat, happy, have a positive outlook no matter what the situation. All I ask in return is to not be screwed with. Don't take me for granted. Don't go and mess up my day just cause you feel like it. Some people don't think twice about yelling at me, calling me names, being rude to me,  and playing head games. I don't do this shit to anyone. And yet this is what I get. Is this the price for being nice? I always hope that I can be a good example. But what am is a doormat. I know deep inside that I'm not doing anything wrong, and that it's the trip of the other people, but that doesn't make me feel any better.  I am under a great deal of stress everyday at work, something that no one around here seems to understand. They all think it's in my head. Sometimes I don't think I can bear another day there, yet I hang in  and try to give it another try. I do my best. Even dealing with anxiety attacks on occasion. For years, I listened to others talk about their jobs, and never was anything but supportive about their decisions. I don't think they could last at my job for a month.  The only true calm time I have is when I'm driving my Vette. I don't think about anything else but the ride. Sadly, I can't do this as often as I would like. Or as often as other people persue their hobbies. I guess I could, but I don't like to  put  things aside to do so. See, I have laundry, shopping, beds to make, a house to clean, a dinner to make, etc. And I get asked why I didn't cut the grass! WTF?  Are you kidding me?!  I'm not cutting the goddamn grass.  It's just the principle of the whole thing. If I'm not appreciated for all I do now, why should I throw lawn work on to the heap? I may be nuts, but I'm no asshole. Cut the grass your own damn self. In fact, the friggin' grass can grow taller than the house, and I wouldn't give a damn.   Right now I feel like getting in my car and driving to Mexico or someplace crazy. I feel like I want to scream. All the way to Mexico. And drink Tequila for a week.   People need to get their shit together, not just share theri neurosis with me, and bring me down too. Talking about it is one thing, but then they gotta do something to change their situation. Me listening to them, and being their sounding board isn't gonna mane their life better. It only makes me feel like shit. And hitting them upside the head. Maybe I just gotta get mean. I do have it in me, I just don't like to deal that way. I'm not a bad vibe kinda person, and I find it hard to send out nastiness. It's not my style. But lately, I'm running out of options, and unleashing my fury may be my only option.  That and picking up a bottle of Tequila.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,July,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best, today was a -3.

But you gotta bear with me here, because this place is going through some major changes, like  I  have in the past few weeks, and I don't know how fast I'm going to get everything done. But I will get it all done as soon as I can. I've missed being here. Things are more frustrating to me now than they used to be. I know that will get better over time. That' part of the reason this will take a bit of time. I get pissed at simple shit really easily right now. It'll be okay though.  This  will help me along. Peace.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>31,October,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      What a beautiful day for the end of October! I have shorts on for goodness sakes. I can't remember the last time it was this warm, at this time of year. Awesome is the only word that can describe this weather. Nick and Amanda left for Niagara Falls this evening, and I'm happy to say that Nick called around 10:30 or so and said that they were in their room relaxing. Amen. I just can't relax till i get that \"We're in\" call.  Untill you're a parent, you don't understand how much rides on that one call. Anyway, I hope they have a fabulous time, and remember to stash lots of hotel freebies in their bags! (You know....shampoos, soaps, etc.)   Trick or Treat was nice this evening, but I don't think we really had that many kids, considering how great the weather was. I was really surprised. I have a hell of alot of candy left over. Too bad I can't enjoy it as much as I used to. Hmf.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>30,October,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      1. Nick & Amanda arriving safely 2. Nice weather for the kids 3. Leftover candy 4.

One of them was to my doctor, for a check up, and for him to sign my return to work paper. Everything checked out ok, except my liver enzyme levels were a bit elevated  due to my meds, so I have to keep an eye on that.  Always something. The rest of the day was rather blah, doing nuthin' special but a bit of last minute yard winterizing. Wooohooo, fun shit. I went to the Dollar Tree tonight and got the wrapping items I need for Nicks birthday gifts, so I'm happy to have that off my \"to do\" list. Now I'm going to put bitsy to bed, get a hot shower and perhaps watch a bit of TV. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>29,October,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      1.

Yes, I am a happy chick indeed! It's always a sad day when I have to put her in winter storage.  No fun till Spring, and that sucks ass. Well, I'm not gonna think about that now. I gotta figure out where I'm gonna cruise to tomorrow. Hmmmmmm. It really doesn't matter, as no matter where I go, I'll have a shit eatin' grin of happiness on my face. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>28,October,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      1.

I have to keep telling myself that hopefully I'll only be there a month, and I can make it through, with my sanity in tact. If my boss even thinks of cutting me slack due to my health issue, I swear I'll lose it.  I need to be out of that place pronto. No looking back. Ever.  One thing I will certainly miss once I start work again, is watching the   urlLink Sharon Osbourne Show  in the morning, on my bed with Bitsy, as I have my coffee and I feed Bitsy her Puppy Chow breakfast . Over the past month and a half, this has become our morning routine, and we really enjoy it. I even catch Bits watching the show from time to time! The show is  awesome . If you haven't seen it yet, you need to check it out at least once.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>26,October,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      1. A warm house 2.

Well, as I'm looking around in Spencers, who should pop up righ next to me? Amanda! What a nice surprise. We walked around together for awhile, then she headed out and so did I. Then,  I got the notion to stop at the party store while I was in the area, and who did I run into there? Joy from work, who has been out on disability just like me. I haven't seen her since Sept. 11th when I had my heart attack, so we hugged and screamed and hugged and smiled in disbelief. We were just so happy to see eachother! Weird shit. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>26,October,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n       Always  carry mascara, lipgloss and/or lipstick and eyeliner with you. Always!

Shit!\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>18,October,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n             Well, I guess the best way to start any story is from the beginning. The only problem is, and this is why I'm not a friggin' writer, is that I'm not a detail person. I don't like to write in detail, I should say.  So, in lieu of alot of details, I'll just stick to the facts.    Over the past few months, alot of changes have been occuring in my world. Some good, and some not so good. As far as the good goes, our family got a new addition in August.  Her name is Bitsy, and she's a feisty, and adorable chihuahua/schnauzer/??? mixed little mutt. She's such a joy to have around, although at times she wears us out with all her energy, and puppy curiousity. I'd forgotten how much work a new puppy is, even though the rewards far outnumber the frustrating times. Still, she can be a handful. Especially in the nipping department. She's 4 months old now, and nipping is one of her bad habits that we're trying to get control of. Her puppy teeth are sharp as nails, and when she takes a bite at your nose..............that shit hurts!! Anyway, we love her to \"bits\"!!   As usual, I've always been one to be full of surprises. Well I had one hell of a surprise on September 11th. I had a heart attack at 9PM on the way home from work. Like I said before, I'm not a detail person, so again I'll just give the facts. First and foremost, I'll always be eternally grateful to my son Nick for taking control of the situation, and calmly getting me help, and staying with me untill 4:30 in the morning, when I was finally admitted to a room. I'll never forget his bravery, in what had to be a totally freaked out situation for him. The 4 days I spent in the hospital are pretty much a blurr now....... of restless nights, endless bloodwork and blood pressure tests, Hubby, Nick amd Amanda visiting me, the lady in my room gasping for air and gagging day and night, and bland hospital food. My only respit was down the hall in the visitors lounge where they had a computer with internet access. At least I could limp down and check my e-mail and some of my favorite sites to pass the time. I limped because my right leg was sore from the procedure where they inserted two stents into a vein in my heart. They go up into an artery in your leg to do this. I don't remember the surgery as the meds just knocked me flat. I was really glad to be let out of tht place. You can't get any fuckin' sleep there!  So anyway, here I am, feeling pretty damn good, and pretty much back to \"normal\" except for no heavy lifting, and being on a low fat diet. Oh yeah, and Cardio Rehab three times a week, which I find to be a royal pain in my ass. thank god that will end in like a week or so. As far as work is concerned, I go back next Saturday, which I'm dreading beyond belief. I hope I can sweat out this month, get fired, and collect unemployment for at least 26 weeks, while I look for a job I will enjoy going to everyday. Or not, we'll see. Hubbs says I really don't have to work if I don't want to, and he's really enjoyed me being at home this month and a half. I must say, I have too. But  I know that sooner or later, I'd have to get out of the house.  I guess I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>05,November,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Now lemme see what I was doing 21 years ago at this time. I was in Magee Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh. We went in at 4am, as labor was to be induced.  Nick was actually due on October 18th. I finally got into a room around Noon, if you can imagine that! To make a long story short, many labor pains and a welcomed epidural later,  Nick was born at 3:02 pm, measuring 21'' and weighing 6lb. 13oz. What a beautiful baby boy! It was the happiest day of my life. Seeing him turn 21, is another. Love you Nick.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>03,November,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      1.

I hate it, always have and always will. So my day started with that mind set. The day seemed to drag, even though we were pretty busy, and my aching feet didn't help matters at all. I made  it through, I made a few sales, and I made it home again. A good day indeed. Now, three days off!

In fact, there were alot of things that I had forgotten all together! But before  I knew it, everything came back to me. The nicest part of my day was that everyone was genuinely happy to see me, and needless to say, that made me feel pretty good inside. It's a,ways nice to know you're missed. I will miss my friends, as dysfunctional as they are, when I leave that place. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,November,2003</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      1.

Gotta get used to this, because I come and go. I'm into this, then I'm not. That's just the way it is with me. And not just with this journal stuff, but with everything in life. I get bored and lose interest in things alot. It's unnerving to me, but I just go with the flow and see where I end up. I never know, so that's what keeps it interesting. I need interesting. But then there's the part of me that loves the comfort of predictability. Damn I'm a confusing person. Therein lies the kaliedescope part. Just shake the damn thing, and everything changes. You never know what it's going to look like or if you'll like it. That's my life. That's what's inside my head. Never a dull moment in this cranium of mine.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>31,March,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Well, everything about my brothers visit was  awesome , execpt the weather. It was cold, damp and dreary.....less than perfect, but we really didn't notice, as we were so happy to spend time together. I know he had a good time, because he spent the night, which he wasn't planning to do in the beginning. He hit the road around 6:30 AM on Sunday morning. The day mostly consisted of Mike sitting outside with Hubby and Jr. while Hubbs was working on Jr's car, which Mike enjoyed alot because first of all he loves car shit, and this gave him a chance to talk \"motorhead\" stuff with the guys, second he got to spend time with Jr, who he hasn't seen in quite awhile. We had lunch, then Mike and I ran up to WalMart for a few things, (there was this cool hat I saw there the other day, but as luck would have it.....gone!), then we hung out at the house for a bit. Mike wanted to go up to the lake while he was here, so around 2:30 or so we headed up to Erie to check out the lake.  (To be continued.....)\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>26,March,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      My brother Mike is coming up to visit us tomorrow and I'm really looking forward to it! Especially since he hasn't been here since Nicks grad party in 2001. Wow! That's a long time between visits, eh? Anyway, he's gonna pick up Nicks \"old\" computer desk to put in his spare room/office to be. I can tell he's really excited to come up, or as he put it \"Road trip\"!!! He's been through sooo much over the past year, with getting divorced and all the adjustments that go along with it. And he's had a really tuff time financially this winter. Poor guy needs a break already. He's such a great guy too. We have alot of time to make up for, as he and I have missed out on alot of years together. (Very long story there!)  Anyway, gotta get things dusted off a bit around here. He said he might get here around 7:30 in the morning tomorrow. Is he fuckin' nuts or what?? I don't even know where I am at 7:30 anymore. Sheesh, I hope I can sway him to get here a tad bit later. *fingers crossed*\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>25,March,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I have to go grocery shopping, and I'm dragging my feet, as this is my least favorite thing to do.

I know it has to do with the weather change, because the dreary days of Winter really bring me down. It's a constant battle to keep myself motivated and in decent spirits. I got down to hard core working out last night, and I feel great about it, and comitted to following through with it every morning and night. I've put on a few pounds & inches since I got out of the hospital, and I friggin' hate  it! But I didn't put on so much that it won't be a breeze to shake off if I just give it some effort. Getting started is always a bitch for me, but once I get rollin' ,watch the hell out!   This Winter mood shit sucks big time. I would really love to do the 6 months here and 6 months in Florida \"Snowbird\" routine. Maybe someday. I mean somedays I don't want to be in the house, but I don't want to go out either. Nothing motivates me, and I just want to nap untill Spring arrives. Whoa.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>15,April,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      I'm very excited!

He was obviously gay, and kept saying \"They look fabulous on you!\" about some of the frames I tried on. It was fun! I can't wait till they come in next week.

Huh? Did I miss something here? I don't know, but the thought of paying those prices makes my skin crawl. Those things  just aren't worth that much . Even if I was filthy rich, I would have one hell of a time with some of those high prices.

I guess I got a bit tired of the rap, old rock and/or pop crap. So I switched it up for a couple of days. One thing I must say though, is country music sure has some pretty love songs.

For no reason in particular, and for everything in general. Some days, like today, everything just seems to come crashing down, making me feel like I'm buried alive and I can't breathe. I want to get out of my skin and run away, from the feeling of panic, but then knowing there's nowhere to run stirs the panic even more. Damn hormonal bullshit combined with this nicotine cessation is a real bitch to deal with. Some days it's a breeze and others, pure hell. I made it through though, with  alot  of reassuring words from Hubby, an Ativan, a hot shower and hopefully, a good nights sleep. Hubbs wants me to ride down to the 'Burgh with him tomorrow to visit with my folks 'till Saturday evening, but I don't know if I'm into that, with the way I've been feeling lately. Lord knows I want to see my parents. I haven't had a decent visit with them in a long while. I just don't know if I can do the overnight thing. Lately, it doesn't take much to throw me into a spin. I don't need that to happen at my folks house. they have enuff stuff to handle, without me having a panic attack while I'm visiting. A daytrip yeah....I just don't know about staying over.

Hell, even the fact that all the chicks in it are skinny doesn't bother me. I always walk away with a smile.  \"I wonder if models repel\" was my favorite saying tonight.   Speaking of chuckles, I've been checking out this Outback Jack show, and I've never laughed so much over a show before in my life. First of all,  where the hell do they find these women ? I can't even believe that there are actually bubble-headed broads like this on the planet. Hmmm, I need to get out more. The fact that they made these air headed bimbos jump out of an airplane to get to the Outback, pleased me to no end. And the fact that they all had evening gowns on that they had to tuck into their jumpsuits, almost made me piss my pants. Then, after they landed from their jump, they had to hike through the outback in their strappy high heels. This is too good to be true. From there, they all screamed ,ran about flailing their arms, whined and complained about everything and anything...especially the first base camp & the bugs. As one \"Bubble-Head\" put it, \"I thought I was going to a 5 star spa or something. I'm just not used to this  at all \". Shoot me now. Oh, but I gotta see what happens to the princesses next week.

I wanted to join this support group for quitting smoking. It has a forum and chat and stuff and I thought that it would benefit me to talk to others who have quit, especially when I'm having on of my rough times. Well, their directions are sketchy for getting into this \"group\", as far as these pledge forms you have to fill out and shit. I couldn't find a link, I didn't know it was a copy & pate thingy. Good fuckin' grief. Hell, if all this aggravation to join the quit smoking forum doesn't make you wanna light up again, nuthin' will sister. (No I didn't do it....Not gonna happen here.) Back to story. So I fill in all this shit, and send it back and guess what???????? I get fuckin'  rejected  not only once.... but 4 times !!!! Can you believe that shit??? I'm soooo pissed. I wanted to write them a nasty letter, but I think then I'll just sound like an asshole, and they'll just say \"Well we don't need the likes of psycho bitch on our boards anyway\". Yet I'm still pissed. What to do?AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH! Their name is  urlLink WhyQuit.com.  Hell yeah, after they get done with you , that's the question your asking yourself......why friggin'quit??????AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!

I watched SITC againt tonight, and I think Pat watched it too, as I mentioned it to her today and she said she'd check it out. I'm anxious to see if she liked it or not. That show makes me realize something. I didn't have enuff girlfriend time as I was growing up. In fact, I really had very little. For some odd reason, I really didn't like \"chicks\" much.

The not smoking thing is really going well, in fact so well that it really surprises me when I think about it. I still have moments when I get blind-sided by the urges, and they're a bitch when they come along, but all in all, it's going along great. I can go  hours  and it doesn't even cross my mind.

Fantastic! I drove up to Erie, around the Bayfront to the Dock and back, and it was so relaxing, I didn't want it to end. Funny thing happened as I was approaching 79......I saw a new Vette flying up on my left, and I thought \"Aw shit, just keep going and don't give me any grief\".  Well, I caught a red light with the \"New and improved Vette\", and when I reluctantly looked over...it was two grey haired fellas,(I'm guessing to be around mid 60's or so!) laughing their asses off just having a blast tooling around town, in their Vette. I couldn't help but get a big grin, and I gave em a thumbs up. Way to go guys, that's what life's all about! Made my night.

This is a miracle, especially since I'm doing it \"cold turkey\" to boot. I never figured I could do this without help of some sort. Go figure. It's not easy, believe me, but it's very rewarding. I literally have to go from minute to minute, as one moment everything is great, and the next I'm  suddenly blindsided  by a terrible urge....and I get anxious for awhile. Sometimes I get really pissed. I have to take deep breaths 'till it passes, which even though it only takes a few moments, sometimes it feel like  forever . Being addicted to something sucks. Getting away from it is no easy matter, but I know I can do this. I will not go back. I've come too far now.

I went to Gabes to get Hubbs some gifts for his birthday, but also to look for a few goodies for myself. It's been months since I've bought anything other than household stuff and groceries. Well, I must say I did pretty well as I found a great pair of Faded Glory white shorts, two cute bangle bracelets, a great sparkly fun ring, an awsome pair of sunglasses and a pair of dragonfly earring that shouted \"BUY US NOW!!!\", so I did. and the best part is I got it all for........drumroll please.......$13.00!! Oh yeah! No buyers remorse here. It felt great, and I must admit I forgot all about my miserable cold the whole time I was shopping. Oh yeah, I did get Hubbs a few things for his birthday, but I still need to find a few more items on the list. I need to do this more often. I had a blast. See, laughters not the  only  best medicine, now is it?

Auctions are sooo exciting and addicting. I'm done with the shawls now that I have the two colors I want. Plus, the lady who has them is wising up and upping her starting bids. Someone must have told her she was not asking enuff for them. Lucky me, I got in and out just in time. Story of my life. Really. \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>21,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      The shawl I won on EBay came today, and I am soooo happy with the quality!

At least I had a pretty good time.&nbsp; Well, the chicken and all the side-dishes were&nbsp; good.&nbsp; Hubby and I stayed at my parents last night, and other than Bitsy waking me up at 5 friggin' AM , then 7AM, then 8:45 AM, to stand out in the backyard, in my pajamas, doing nuthin', no pee, no poop, no friggin' nuthin', I slept pretty well! I'm glad to be home though. I'd like to go down to my folks for a couple of days alone, just to hang out, and&nbsp; help them around the house with a couple of things.&nbsp; There's a few things that could use a good cleaning, and I like scrubbing someone elses house alot better than my own! Much more interesting indeed. So maybe in a few weeks I'll head down for a little visit. For now, I'm heading to dreamland, as I'm tired from all those early morning activities.&nbsp; *yawm* Goodnight!&nbsp; ;)    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>16,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Okay.

Nuthin' special, just one of those days where you're very content just being \"homey\", if you know what I mean. I cleaned a bit, washed clothes a bit, baked some super yummy brownies, put a vintage bedspread from my grandma on my bed for a summer change,(It looks very \"cottage-y\"), went to the church store to browse, and came home with $3.40 worth of \"treasures\", and then cooked a wonderful fried fish dinner, that I must say, was the  best  I've ever made. Hubby agreed. I told him it was due to the $.79  fish breading mix I got at WalMart last week. I  will  stock up on that stuff. Damn it was good! I accidentally burned my arm with hot oil, as I was frying the fish. That sucked. I'll live. All in all, a neat day. Muggy as hell(literally) outside though. What do I know. Maybe hell has dry heat, like Phoenix. Anyway, I'm so glad we have our little air conditioner chugging away in the living room.  Humidity and I have never been very good friends. In fact, we loathe eachother.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>13,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Cute potholders I got today for .20 each, at the church discount store!  urlLink   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>12,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      A beautiful bouquet my wonderful Hubby gave me today!  urlLink   \r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>09,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      Went to Gabes and found this cute jelly bag for $3.00!

Ugh. I've been in a really terrible state of mind lately, and I think that getting out and about amongst the costume jewelry, the racks of bright summer clothing, and all the delightful accessories would lift my spirits, all right. Only problem is cashola. $$$$$.  I think I need to get a job soon. I'm thinking Fall, if I can hold out that long.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n<date>01,July,2004</date>\r\n<post>\r\n\r\n\r\n       \r\n      No words needed for these.

I loved it when you could actually see music videos. Do you remember when you could see music videos on MTV? Damn it seems like ages ago, doesn't it? I tuned in tonight, and I saw a  dreadful  show about Jessica Simpsons sister, Ashlee. I just don't know what to say. Like having Jessica on a show isn't bad enough.\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n</post>\r\n\r\n\r\n</Blog>",
