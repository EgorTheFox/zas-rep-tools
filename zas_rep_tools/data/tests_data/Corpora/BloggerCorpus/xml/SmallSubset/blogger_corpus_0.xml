      uhhhhhhh... I don't know. Brooke got my e-mail... yeah. chatted with her a bit... don't know.  I just don't understand. you think... maybe that's my problem... you think things are going one way, stuff happens, list of possible reasons for stuff happening, then when inquiry is made, nothing is really cleared up. not sure if things actually were going the way you had thought, not sure why stuff happened, not sure what to do, just know that Brooke doesn't feel well. and I'm afraid that it's my fault.  she doesn't want our friendship to change. I don't want our friendship to change. she doesn't want it to be weird, she says she doesn't feel weird. I don't want it to be weird, I don't know how I feel. I still like her, I know that, but I am brought back to the question of fascination... she doesn't want a relationship at this point, ok, that's all well and good but... she doesn't think she feels the same way but she's never thought about it. I don't know, I don't know, I don't know...God help me, I think I'm losing again.&#13;

      I did it. I just finished writing Brooke; telling her how I felt; laying it all out on the line.  I would rather of done this in person, face to face, but I truly felt that God wanted me to do it now. OH GOD! you are my only hope, my salvation, my King. to You be the glory and honor forever and ever. Amen.&#13;

      waiting... waiting for the mail man... or at least the you have new mail signifier on the computer... I'm sure everyone is just busy... at least that's what I'm going to believe for now. habitat was sweet as molassas! of course there are things to improve, but that'll always be the case. I'd have to say that it was a complete success, especially for the first night. but if we can keep the numbers we had tonight, and have that to grow from, that would be sooo sweet. sweet like the swiss chocolate I had yesterday. mmm mmm good!   Johnny was back at work today... it's good that he's back around after his 10 day hiatus south of the mason dixon line. then our boss John was just extra JF today. I don't know what his deal is. Bobeng attributes it to his diabetes. I suppose that's a good reason, but geez! I really need to start making some money on the side. Windy City just doesn't cut it if I want to actually get an apartment. yikes! financial resposibility. oh, it turns out that my parking ticket fine was due yesterday. so I missed out on that, have to pay an extra $10 now. what really bites it is that when my mom called me at work to tell me, I found out she was sick with a massive fever and just getting ready for my dad to come home and take her to the doctor. God bless health insurance! I hope she gets better soon, she seems to have this nasty habit of sickness clinging to her. here's to God breaking that curse!  well hopefully soon I'll now something more. I'm still waiting for some form of enlightenment.&#13;

      another day another reason to keep going... had the big true love waits ceremony in youth tonight. everything ended up going really well which is always a good thing. worship was smokin' and everbody seemed in a good mood. after youth we set up for the first night of habitat tommorrow. it took a while for us to get it all together, but it's lookin' quite nice. Alex is doin' a kick ass job with the lights, and the band gets tighter every time they play. once it was all finally set up, we took some time and prayed for everyone there ("the hot seat") it was good, and much needed I think. Handler is quite sick, runnin' a 102 temp earlier in the day, I'm prayin' that he's feeling better tommorrow. hopefully God and those antibiotics he got today will do the trick. ahhh, then Denny's. always a treat. well it was denny's, nuff said.   I still haven't sent in my payment for that stupid parking ticket, it has to be there by Friday! I'll have to spend more and send it overnight or something now. grrrr! got to send in my car payment too! stupid growing up and being responsible thing. I hope that I can do a good job of teaching my kids early to be financially responsible, it only get harder to learn as you get older...   sent off a couple e-mails to people I haven't seen in some time now last night. it was good to hear from them again. I hope that we can do a better job of keeping up with one another again this time. I always enjoy conversation; even if it is over e-mail. then when I do see them again at least I have some idea of what's been happening and we're able to just enjoy each other's presence. both of 'em (girls I've previously had interest in actually) have serious relationships right now. probably headed toward marriage. I'm less sure about one than the other, but both seem to be doing well. it's kind of weird that the last three girls I've liked are all in relationships headed toward marriage. one is gettin' hitched early this summer even! no matter, I'll have my day soon enough. whenever God decides that it's time. Brooke... hmmm... nothing further as of now. I wrote her last night as well, but I haven't heard back. I wish I knew what was going on inside that pretty little head of hers.  looking forward to tommorrow. looking forward to learning more about God and having a deeper relationship with Him. looking forward to ending this post and going to bed. &#13;

      ok, so I'm the only one on this blog right now and I've been doing a rather poor job of continuing to add to it... well the Brooke update is quick... it's still peanut butter man! at least I think it's creamy now instead of crunchy... that has to mean it's getting better right? I haven't really talked with her though so it may crunch yet...   I spend too much money! I have to slow down here... save some money for things I really want, or even put it towards paying off my bills in a more rapid time frame. alas... a lass... now that would be nice!  working on a new song, not quite there yet with the lyrics but I think I have a good title for where the song seems to be headed: questions and apologies. maybe I'll just list it as Q&amp;A on the outside of the cd I'll have someday(hopefully by the summer)... and then perhaps the full title can be written out inside... hmmm... ideas, thoughts... we'll see. I realized that I have much more free time than I had previously realized... I believe I should use this time a bit more wisely than I have been up to this point. not that I don't enjoy the time with my friends, but rather than it just being routine for me to "hang out" with them, I would like to spend more time playing/writing music, reading, studying, praying, and even just plain soaking in God. oh man oh man, that would be sooo great!   gotta get my music in order, record a cd, play shows... gotta gotta praise God, live my life as worship... (that should really be listed first!)... lookin' forward to habitat (it's going to be freakin' rad yo) gotta make more money(pay off some bills, save some money, get some more musical and sound equipment) gotta make sure to be attentive to keeping up friendships, can't lose 'em, become distant  aright... God bless any who happen upon this (by the way, if your reading this, you're prolly the only one) so long...&#13;

      you know what i hate most of all?  i hate the fact that i don't care about things.  i am too apathetic.  oh well.  i also hate the fact that people just ruin my hopes and dreams.  i have dreams that i will be getting back together with "her," and that everything will be alright.  but i have this friend who thinks other wise and rains on my parade that she doesn't see us together... she tells me this everytime i have a conversation with her.  this angers me.  i give advise to a lot of people, i encourage them and what not... and then in turn they say i am wrong for hoping we get back to the who dating scene. (am i lonely or what?) oh well, what can i do?  basically nothing.  sucks.  and no jeremiah, she doesn't have man parts.hey! at least i don't think about her all the time anymore.  but i do think about her when i am alone (ahem, now!).&#13;

      alright... perhaps things are getting better... actually had a somewhat "normal" conversation (or em, chat) tonight. that's a plus. had a good night tonight. free dinner compliments of John Bobeng. (Gino's East is sooo good!) got my ears stretched; thanks Pat. then went to Denny's for coffee with Jeremiah. stupid waiters don't understand that when two people come in, just order coffee, that they want to drink coffee. only two cups, and we were there a good two hours. what kind of crap is that? oh well. looking forward to the Ben Folds show tommorrow night. aaaaaahh shizzle... later yo!&#13;

      today was mundane. i hate mondays.  nothing ever good comes out of them.  seems like we all have girl trouble, or maybe lack there of.  i think "she" likes me still but doesn't have the man-parts (figuratively) to admit it.  ah well.  i ain't over her, but hopefully i will be soon.  all this is taking too much of a toll on me.  i mean, i am lonely.  very lonely.  questions arise.  "did she ever love me?" "is i always going to be like this?" "do girls find me attractive"  "if yes, why doesn't someone let me know?!?!?!" ah well.  i am not to answer those. transmission end.&#13;

      handler, glad to see you could make it!  well i know you all want to hear what really did happen to me today (long silence...for thinking) oh i know NOTHING!!!!!!!!! still no women in my life, still uncertian if i should count that as a blessing or a curse. still bored out of my gord. i really need to touch someone...uh...mmmmmm...with music. (soooo dirty). hmmm the "X" just signed on lets sit back and watch it get interesting....(moments later)......so far so good....sooner or later its going to get ugly, thats just the way it goes. (more moments later)................. ....."conversations kill"....well the "X" just signed off, amazingly enough i felt no anger from this conversation. she told me she met a guy, now just what does that mean? who gives a flying rat's anus!!! i know it sounds like i'm hurt, but i'm not. she just says alot of stuff that serves no purpose. and i'm spent&#13;

      well, well... I am quite satisfied right now; having had a bowl of spaghetios w/franks(plus a little spice) and a wonderful glass of milk.  I really need to discipline myself... I was an hour late for work  again !! ah well... the rest of the day was quite nice actually(as of yet, and I assume nothing less for tonight) I bought a compressor... yes I'm very happy about that.   sometimes... I wonder, how much of a gomer am I really? I think too much, one of these days that will work to my advantage. I just hope it isn't my downfall...  why can't I just leave things well enough alone? we shall see. yes, we shall see.  ttfn  (ta ta for now) &#13;

      well.  you know about that conversation?  it was the best thing that could have happened.  we put the past behind and are looking forward, being friends.  though i pine for her, that will have to cool on the back burner.  but it is soooooooo hard.  anywho.  turn about was good.  but i am anti-social, so it was nerve racking.  my "date" is selective-social.  so it was ok.  i think she digs me.  she is one of my X's.  she wanted to dance at all the slow songs... i didn't mind.  she got real close on the last song.... woah.  she looked like she wanted to lock lips... big woah.  i know she ain't the one for me.  i still think "she" is.  kinda funny how we have other names for the girls not in our life.  food for thought: don't go to turn about with an X.. and... umm.... sometimes the "regrowth" is better that the initial growth.  end transmission&#13;

      first off, stupid geocities is discontinuing their ftp, so I have to find another site to put this thing on... no worries, I will remedy this situation, and I will create a link to the new page when it exists so you don't have problems finding it, or remembering the new address. now on to the next...  what is it about girls that drives us so mad?  is it their unique thought processes, the way they look(yes their figure, but no I'm not suckered into the American stereotype of what one should look like), the way they walk, their smell, or is it that God saw it wasn't fit for man to be alone and so created woman to partner with us, keep us company, love... perhaps it's because of God giving us the wonderful gift of women that all of those little things about them attract our attention and make us want them so. so here we are, let's call ourselves men, longing after some girl to come along side us and share her life with us, that we can love and share our life with... (perhaps someone specific, perhaps the idea or just someone...) but it seems like every turn, every curve in the road, we get frustrated and confused because they are different, they don't think the same way as us, the react strangely to things, and we just don't understand.  but we go on, hoping that the next time it will be different, that this time she'll "come around" and everything will work out for once... then we're left wondering if it'll ever "work out," if their truly is someone for us, or if we're doomed to an existence of solitude, with no one their to share life with, no one to love and to cherish 'til death do we part.(and hopefully not even then)  do they realize what their doing when they do it? do they even realize it anytime afterward?  God help me, God help us all.  nuts in a vice... "shaking head no" (sigh)  &#13;

      i wish i were over her already.  i want to be.  i have this "talent" of being really depressed and drawing it out.  i hate this.  i wish that it would just be over.. not nessisarly seeing someone else, or even looking for someone else... but just to have a mutual friendship.  i guess thats what i miss most of all, that we aren't friends.  my friend says she thinks that i hate her.  i don't.  i want to be her friend.  if i hated her, why would i still want to be with her!!! can anyone answer me this?! arg.  why did i ever fall so deep for a girl?  i let my guard down only to have my heart ripped out.  and guess who i am talking to now?  i hope this conversation doesn't turn deep.  my body can't take it.. i can't take it.  why are boys this prone to getting the nuts in a vise?  well, i guess only the male species can.  wow, what a thought.  food for thought: NEVER DATE!  it hurts, and i am much to young to know this pain.  happy news, i am going to turn-about.  yeha!&#13;

      normalcy is going to kill me one of these days... it's nice when you have a friend you can share things with, and they can share things with you, you're able to converse, joke around, even flirt a little... it becomes hard when one side develops feelings for the other, it becomes harder when the other finds out and doesn't know how to react. it's nice when the other side starts coming around again, and you can start having conversations again (no matter how small, or seemingly meaningless) I still don't regret any part of it.  you know, jon hartsaw writes some good music. I'm listening to his most current addition to  urlLink mp3.com.  it's really good. speaking of good music. I went to the Volta do Mar show tonight and their quite amazing as well. all this reminds me how much I want to take time to work on my own music. I know I have some good stuff, and that I could put something together worth buying, worth playing out, I just need to take the time to do it. Casey wrote me an e-mail the other day (I still need to respond to that, speaking of responding... later) telling me about some oportunities up in the Madison area, asked me how things were coming along down here, wondered if our project was still on, or if it should be shelfed for a while. he has spring break soon, said he could maybe come down... that would be good, I think he should really do that. it would be nice to play with him again. maybe there's a show that week that we could go to as well... hmmm.... have to look into that some more. man... no... God, I need to play, I need to write, I need to get out and share it with the world, I need to share You with the world, the gifts You've given me, and the experiences I've had... I know it's all for a reason... or at least You can use it that way(does everything have a reason for happening, I don't really think so, but I know this has, I have, purpose; God reveal!)   ahhh, the cool determination of steel.&#13;

      okay, so it 3:30am, and I have to be at work in four hours... that's right at work no later than 7:30am. no church for Seth yet again, and this time it's not because I'm sleeping! John and I have to be done by 11 anyway, so at least I can go meet everyone afterward. it's funny, the way God works. I took Tom Anderson home tonight. It was really cool. we talked about a couple different things, and when we got to his house, we prayed before he went inside. he's actually quite a caring person, he just has a lot of "baggage" at this point in his life. I'm going to make a point to be more courgal to him from now on.   Souled Out was really good tonight. when I first got there the power was out. it came back on about the end of worship, which gave the opportunity to use a mic for the message. Mrs. B spoke to the people who frequent Souled Out. how people seem to have lost the sense of loving others as yourself, which Jesus says is no less important than loving the Lord your God with all your heart sould mind and strength. it was really good.   I'm kind of stupid and... well just plain stupid sometimes. I'm happy for him... I hope that it all turns out well, whether they end up back together or go on as plain ol' regular friends. God bless the both of them.  Guess who was on at 3 in the morning? yep, exactly. things seem to be going well... I suppose we'll know for sure when next our paths cross.(in actual person that is)  I get to play acoustic for church tommorrow night! yeah, I'm looking forward to it, I haven't played for church since I moved down here this past fall. it'll be nice. Ted's playin' drums, Ray on the keys, Matt leading... saaa..weet!  oh man, speaking of excited about cool things... I got a compressor today. ok, so maybe you don't know what that is, but I do, and I like it. good night all... &#13;

      Hey ya'll. This being my first venture into the world of the blogging, I will keep it characteristically short and sweet. First of all I gotta give a shout out to all my homies, you know who you are. Secondly to any of my brothers out there who are experiencing the woes of women still, remember always that this is a mere moment in time, the future speeds steadily towards us, and with it the future brings more women, more chances for heartache, and finally that ever elusive opportunity to find " The One". Good luck to you gentlemen. I'll be posting more often now that Seth hooked me up. A moment in time.........&#13;

      so people don't really contribute here all that much... I'm not sure what to do about that, maybe I should write here more... that would probably be a good start. well, all in all things have been going pretty well... AC2002 was good, I went home for Easter, which was nice to spend some time with my family, although I was in an accident, it was the other person's fault, and no one was hurt, so that's good, Habitat is tommorrow, I'm starting to spend more time with God, praying/reading, I really want to become more passionate about God again... (almost down to two years)... yeah... my finances need help. what's new right? I really have to get things in order there. God help me! I'm tired. I've been getting to work closer to on time... I'm actually busy most of the day with shipping and receiving, it's kind of nice cuz it makes the day go by quicker. now, I'm all for savoring time, living in the moment, etc etc... but suffering through boredom because there's nothing to do, and you can't exactly just read, sleep, or go somewhere is not enjoyable by any stretch. I have reading to do, and I'm quit tired... I really need to link to here from the old page...&#13;

      i don't have much to say, but what i haveto say is important enough for me to even think of it. food for thought: when looking for a girl, don't stuck in between the devil and the deep blue sea... umm... ummm... hmmm.. i think tat my time worrying about "her" is over.  at least for now anyway.  i am happy to be out of that bondage, and onto more important stuff than being hurt.  end transmission.&#13;

      monday... monday monday.  it's too dang hot.  tax day is a pretty miserable day, ya know?  today was a good day besides the heat.  i came to the realization that my future is uncertain.  my occupation is still very much up in arms, there are so many things that i want to be.  there is so much i want to do, there is on i want to be with.  all seem like they won't happen.  i know i have to give it up all to God, but patience isn't my strong point.  alls i know is that i want to get out of the High School Trap.  it sucks worse that this weather.  oh well.  there ain't much i can do, and i really think i am falling for another young woman.  food for though: you know when you are in trouble when you stick to your shirt.  end transmission&#13;

      perhaps I'll do what I can to keep this thing alive myself... if that doesn't work then I'll re-hash things later...  today was good... yep. I got up around 12:30pm, had some cereal, got on the internet. that's what I did for about the next two hours. then jeremiah called, he came over to check his e-mail while I showered, and then we were off... to the library to get tax forms. heh, just getting my tax forms on April 14... am I a procrastinator or what?  drove around, got some food, played my two new songs(rather poorly) for j... drove around, walked around downtown arlington heights, got some jolt at 7-11(the best convenience store around) and went to the concert over at heart 'n soul. it was good. sea and ocean were much better than I remember them being, jon hartsaw was spectacular, the blamed rocked, and denison marrs was way cool. what else could you possibly jam into an already jam-packed day of amusement... denny's of course. i laughed so hard tonight it hurt for an hour afterwards. the good kind of hurt though... the one that reminds you how much fun you had, not that makes you wish you hadn't... enough rambling about that... I'm not even going to try to relate what happened... it was just too funny. now I'm home, doing my usual round of web sites and wondering why it is that I seem to get through it faster and faster each time... I either need to find more sites to visit on a regular basis, or get a life... I think the first is more likely.&#13;

      ok.. so I can't seem to get to the blog page right now... but I feel like writing anyway... it'll go up some time. I don't know if I'll finish my story of last weekend. bits and pieces will probably trickle out in other entries for a while and most anyone who knows about this has probably heard about it in at least one form or another..  I was supposed to go to a wedding today. I ended up going to work instead. my boss was being dum the other day so I just figured I'd avoid the hassle and deal. I called my mom and she said she would relate how sorry I was for not being able to make it yadda yadda... I've missed other weddings within my extended family, but this one I really wanted to go to... oh well. at least I can go to souled out tonight... and hopefully since I didn't take off today, it won't be a problem to have off may 7. I really really reaaaaally need that day off. got a gig. not just any gig either... a good payin' gig. plus I don't want to leave casey hanging. that really sux dude!  I started working on recording some stuff last night. greg from work is lending me a  juice  mic and a mic pre... very nice. just recording straight to cd... I can eq and compress blah blah later... the mic is sweet... my performance wasn't the best... grr.. I brought home the cdr from work again.. so I can work on it some before souled out and tommorrow... yeah it's quite fun.  gotta get a  trade 'n times . see how much I can find amps for in there.. vic said he got his fender twin for about $600, and that the average going price is like $500... I'd go for a used twin over a new deville... yeah the deville would be nice have a warranty blah blah.. but it's retailin' at like $740... a better amp for less=seth buys the better amp and has money to spare for something else... yeah I like that idea. we'll see though, yes we shall.  why so much confusion huh? why? I'm growing to hate it...  love is not self-seeking..  I'm trying to learn that... in once instance I think I have it, or at least I'm close... another...  I'm not sure. I think I read into things too much... that I'm always trying to figure out what she's thinking, why she said this, why she did that... it's all quite too much for me.   God help me! please Lord I'm drowning here...   are you holding out your hand to me? am I supposed to have learned already and your waiting for me to realize it? I'm calling out to you..   HELP!!!   ok... I'm gonna jet... take a shower, work on some music.. later yo.&#13;

      ... where to start ... if told in full, this could take quite some time.. I guess I'll just start, and if need be I'll continue it later... I won't say finish it tommorrow, cuz tommorrow is likely to add to it... anyways...  so I called in sick to work friday... (this caused some difficulties with co-workers on monday but it was worth it..) took some time to finally fix my guitar, (I replaced the switch, but had it wired wrong, fixed that) chatted some with a friend on-line, showered, packed my van, left my house about 2:30pm. had to get gas and snacks, then took off for lockport, home of my friend brooke... I got there about 3:30 quarter to 4.. I think.. anyway, at which time I proceeded to wait for brooke to finish getting ready for her show, and talk on the phone. weird. when she was on the phone, she looked up at one point and the way she did it, the way she looked, reminded me a lot of my mom. weird. once we got her car loaded, we went and got ice cream (or ous cream, which is what brooke called it... I complimented her on the full house reference) chocolate vanilla twist cone.. mmmmm.. we got to where her show was about 5:30. I did more waiting there. she was all walking around and stuff(much the same as the rest of the night) so I was left to entertain myself. I played her guitar for a little while... the obnoxious noise of bands "setting up" their equipment soon became too much for me to overcome, so I stopped. at one point I lay on the floor staring up at the ceiling for a few peace filled minutes... I decided against staying there long however.. found my way to my bag, where I produced a copy of the little prince, (well a printed from the internet copy) good book (thanks jess for all the references that caused me to want to read it myself) read that for a while... brooke un-happy, I asked her how she was doing... she didn't want to play... didn't feel her music fit in with the other bands... I understood what she meant, but nothing I could say was going to make that situation any better... (i seem to find myself in that predicament a lot.. wishing I could do something, knowing there's nothing I can) she didn't want to read my book, her loss, I bet she'd enjoy it.. later I told her I kind of felt like making a fool of myself... she told me if I did she wouldn't stand by me.. I didn't... I think I got jipped on the amount of time she actually stood by me though... grr..  daniela showed up at some point... can't remember if before the first band or during... whatever.. that made brooke happier, and gave me someone else to talk to(seeing as brooke was quite the wanderer most of the night) I ended up running sound for her when she played; so that was cool. as I was sitting on the floor near daniela during the last band, I learned what it is to rock. oh man, it's 4am.. I gotta work tommorrow, this sucks.. I'm gonna end here. explanation of what it is to rock will come next entry... rockin'&#13;

      does it make me a real nerdface that I am on my third consecutive post to the same blog? whatever.. so I've been having some small enjoyment in leaving odd remarks in people's guestbooks. sometimes it has to do with something on their site, sometimes it prolly makes no sense what-so-ever. I commented the other day how it would just be nice to have a place to do laundry. well... I can't use the washer where I live anymore, no it's not just me because I did something dum and am being punished.. if the washer is used the floor drain floods the basement. (in case you don't realize, that's a bad thing) hey... maybe you should sign my guestbook k? you know, all 3 of you that even now about this site. I'm out.&#13;

      so what does all this mean? the family I live with got notice that they have to move out in a month. she's going to talk to the guy, say she can't do anything 'til the second week in june. work's really busy right now and there's no way she can get time off to move. plus I'm thinking that it would suck to move when there's only a week or two left of school.(she has two kids in school) I'm not sure where that leaves me. I know she said before, like when I first moved in, that there was the possibility they'd have to move, and that wherever they went there would prolly be room for me, but having only a month, reality tells me I'm not a priority in her search for living accomodations. she hasn't said anything to that affect, but it's what I'm thinking. so do I try to find a place of my own? I can't afford living by myself. say's who? say's $9/hr and 4 years of school bills on three credit cards and a loan from great lakes. ughh! I don't know, I don't know!  I DON'T KNOW!!!  ... i don't know. &#13;

      i don't know where I'm going with this..  friends.. hmmm... yeah.  saturday, after the message(s) at souled out, there was an altar call etc.. I was up front for a little while, talked a little with mark, prayed, and then a little after that I went over to where the pool tables used to be, and is now a ping pong table. so I'm standing over there against the wall when tim comes up to me..(he didn't know who I was... he just knew he had to come up to me and say something in order to be faithful to God) he says something to the affect of; even if everyone else leaves you, God is still there and will never leave you. it's a cool statement, and even cooler that someone would go up to someone they don't know to relay it. and it's true, I know it is, but it's got me wondering if it's a warning. like that I need to remember that statement, that fact, because everyone  is  going to leave me(or at least it will seem like it) ok God, it's all well and good that you wanna say how you'll never leave me, and it's fine to put in even if everyone else does... but if you take away all my friends to prove a point, or cause me to grow, it's going to suck. yeah it'll be worth it in the end cuz I'll have learned something, matured or whatever. but why doI have to go through all this suck time huh? the easy road is not the one you intended for us; love is not self-seeking; ... so the next year and a half huh? gonna be quite the growing time isn't it? in some ways I look forward to it... in others... well I only have one word: !@#%! ...yeah. &#13;

       3 blogs, 2 guestbooks, 5 posts. what a productive morning I've had. yeah right.   problems come and go. feelings run deep like the ocean, but is the ocean ever the same when you look at it a second time? emotions have played themselves dry and weary from overuse, and my mind is collapsed from the strain I place upon it in my thinking. and then, maybe the ocean is still the same, just in it's vast expanse you are able to see a new area of it everytime.  so I'm pretty much.. ?? well that's a good question really. mostly, in a day to day sense, life is good. when I start to try and see down the road however, even today becomes foggy.  I gotta stop being... pessimistic? maybe just thinking over things so much.. I don't know... "don't take the easy route its not the one god planned for you" thanks daniela that's a good statement. one I need to work on for sure. work in 45min, the shower is callin' my name... &#13;

      ok I found this link on another page and just had to find out...  urlLink Hobbit Personality Test  so here's how I turned out...  You are most like  Frodo Baggins, Son of Drogo  With many acquaitenances, Frodo is deeply attached to a few people, like Bilbo, Aragorn, Gandalf, and Sam. His high ethics come out in his treatment of Gollum and Saruman. Frodo has pity on Gollum and believes that change can occur. You have a strong personal morality. You are committed to relationships and their growth. You tend to be an idealist, believing the best of the world around you. Time alone is important and solitary activities refresh you. You have a tendency to introspection. While providing compassion and being considerate, you may have the tendency of being soft-hearted or even "too emotional" You like keeping your options open. Closure is probably not one of your strong suits.   The Orcs display the evil side of this personality with their lengthy torture methods.  Traits: Empathic, benevolent, looking to the future. On the dark side you could be sadistic.   so... at least some of that is true... I wonder what other people think? &#13;

      ok, for clarification on the "no thanks required" post left on jess' messageboard...  I may swallow my foot, but here goes... to say that I never had thought of jess would be a lie. to say it went beyond passing thoughts caused by frustration due to my liking of someone else and failing to seem to get anywhere with her would also be untrue. so no, I don't have "feelings" for jess. I'm not looking for a "relationship" with her. not interested ok?   if my saying that isn't enough for you... let me give you some further evidence that what I say is true. for some may still be wondering, "why would he leave something like that, referencing  the little prince  no less, on jess' site if it wasn't about her?" or.. "he sure seemed to be around her a lot for someone who isn't interested in her" or... whatever..   1. i am interested in someone else. simple, yet to the point, I'll stop here on this one..  2. for some reason, when I was down at ISU visiting her last weekend, there was a noticable shift in my perspective of her. not that I was "interested" in her, she was cool, she was my friend, that's it. but as I was sitting there talking to her, she became my sister. I won't go into great detail here, but I actually thought to myself, "it's like I'm her brother." unlike some people, this was an entirely new thing for me. I've never felt that way about anyone before. don't get me wrong, there have been people that I have cared deeply about, but I have never had that actual thought before "it's like I'm her brother" it was a very cool moment for me.  so.. I do care for her.. that much is true. do I "like" her? no. I hope this is clear, I hope that I haven't shot myself in the foot with something I said here... this is seth leonard.. good day.&#13;

      Another prayer offered in earnest honesty. Do you hear when your back is forever turned? Survival is all I seek, not glory, not riches, to merely find an answer has become a task. The essence of love; the ardor of pain, the stench of decay and I'm left alone to find the answer to every question in my own mind. Is it worth the effort it takes to stand? Is it worth the pain that floods in with each foreign gasp for air? Another prayer goes unanswered and I rot. The escape screams to me frm the shelf, from the closet, from the drawer, from the depths and recesses of my very soul. Bound to endure, destined to drown, I scream to quiet its noise, I laugh to loosen its grip, I cry to realize I'll never have the strength. The escape gains strength every day, and every day I lose. Question, answer delayed, new queston, answer delayed, question fades, answer delayed. I wait for the day my voice gives out and I give in. Waiting for those who couldn't care to care less. Did it make you feel powerful to close the door on me? The soundtrack to my life should be the deafening thud of every door that's ever slammed in my face, and the title should be "Every Back Turned." Let me down. It didn't stop you before, why should it stop you now? You've only known these people for four months, you claim to love me. You'll never see these people again, you claim ti want to be with me forever. They will have long forgotten you by the end of the summer, you're etched in my heart like a scar. Yet, somehow I know it's me you'll choose to let down. I never tried to stop you. Was it a powerful moment? Did you feel release? Will your joy eternally be at my expense? For once in my life I'd like to be the one to slam the door and turn my back in indifference and smile through someone else's pain, and laugh and enjoy life. Somewhere, thousands of miles away, the faint sound of another door slamming in my face. Echo, reverberate, enjoy. It's your dream.  &#13;

      well tonight we broke down from habitat in record time.. I hope that I remembered everything... not much I can do now. anyway, the reason: spiderman. I wasn't sure how it would be; even after hearing nothing but good things about it. I must say however that it was quite good. I won't ruin it for anyone who is still yet to see it, but I was a bit dissappointed in the ending. :( ah well, tis but a movie.   I'm looking forward to summer being here. not only for warmth, but because it will enable more friends to be able to hang out more often. case in point.. jess is coming home this weekend. (sure, she's only here for two weeks, but you gotta take advantage of what time you get) hopefully both Mike and Jake will be able to stay out  intead of having to go home to do homework now as well. there are others as well that I hope to spend more time with, but I think I'll stop here. (at least for now)   I got my van back. actually I got it back tuesday night, but I haven't written since before that so... well now you know. (and knowing is half the battle ;)  It's nice to be driving my Alice again. (my friend that agreed the name of my van should be Alice, wanted me to spell it Alyss, and I went with it for a time, but I think I just like Alice. if you read this, tell me what you think in my  urlLink guestbook  Alyss or Alice) she still needs some work done on her, and a good bath and vaccuuming are in order, but.. well, you understand, right?   I still have a lot to learn.. &#13;

      soo... my van broke today. yeah suck! I was driving from souled out to meet alex at the shop (I was supposed to load out a show with him in schaumburg. thanks matt for helping him out.) I went to turn... *wobble* *wobble* no turn-y. hello busted tie rod.. hello I can't afford this. (God provides though right? yes, yes he does) worrisome is how I would describe my mood. after my van got towed, as mike was driving me home he decided it would be best to pray... agreeing with him, he began to pray. as he was praying, not that I was distracted, or not paying attention, but it struck me I could prolly write a killer country tune about my evening. yeah.. maybe I will just for fun.. hmm... maybe not. anyway, it made me laugh to myself. first time I felt better since I became parked in the middle of rand road.   I finished a roll of film today. my last picture was of the gas pump I filled up at today. the pump handle said " Thirsty? " it just struck me as funny. I gotta get this roll developed this week. I know I have some interesting pics on there, and I can't wait to see how they turned out. well I suppose I have to, but... ahhhh!! ok so, I don't really wanna talk anymore. lata&#13;

      I am nothing more than a lame man denying his crutch. I wait for the hand of eternal healing and pray that in my own selfish idiocy I don't disregard the answer as just another obstacle to overcome. There is such a thin line we tread between asking God for the desires of our heart and not making the desires of our heart the selfish lusts of our flesh. Sometimes the line blurs, often it seems to not exist at all, this all due to the fact that we are a self focused group of neurons. Can I question something that feels as if it is God's will? Who am I to do so. This web of questions entangles me. Selflessness; something I thought I had, I thought I posessed, I thought I was showing. Am I wearing my selflessness as an ornament to feel as though it somehow makes me deserve you? Do you see my selflessness? Now there is a backwards statement/ question if ever one existed. I want you to know that I love you and that this seperation hurts, but is that merely because I want you to see that I fight for you? I said I don't deserve you yet all I say and do is to make myself feel otherwise. God, I rest in your infinite wisdom. Help me take my eyes off myself and learn true selflessness.&#13;

      wow.. so I've done absolutely nothing today. I feel like writing something, but I'm really not sure what I have to say.. so this could be interesting. ( or really dull..)   I've started to wonder if staying up all day was a good idea or not. I think I may get some coffee on the way to church tonight. church... part of me would rather not go this evening. I'm sure I'll still be there anyway. setup for habitat after service. gotta be there for that.  definitely need coffee. after we get stuff ready for habitat (go through sound check and all that) I'm sure we're goin' ta denny's. can't not go, the reprecussions would be horrible. ok, so maybe that's a bit severe but..   so I've effectively avoided thinking of much of anything the past 24 hours or so. I'm not sure if it's because I had John's project to concentrate on or... well, maybe that conversation I had with  urlLink jess  really helped. (thanks a lot jess.. it means a lot to me :)   I think the latter is the case. along with God working in me of course. He's been tryin' to do that a lot lately. I hope He's successful. man o' man, do I. I still feel the same about her. I still ...    "it's an attitude"   yeah.&#13;

      up all night. recorded johnny.. actually ted's drums mostly.(for johnny's project,  saturday came too soon ) I was up 'til 'bout six am. john and ted finished up while I took a three hour nap. wonderful! ;) since I got some sleep, I decided that if I went to bed I would end up sleeping too much, so I just figured I'd stay up instead.  it took quite some time to get everything set up and working. I think we got some good stuff though. ted's sleeping down stairs right now.    someone, someday, you &#13;

        something worth keeping    ok, so I'm not sure I still agree with my last entry, but I'll leave it stand, at least for now, 'cuz that's what I was thinking/feeling then... I had a great time just chillin' with  urlLink jess  tonight. we went to this restaurant where this old guy was rude to us, and then we went to 7-11, and then we hung out at chuck's house, and then we went and got apple juice for ryan(and other hilarious b-day things) and then hung at chuck's some more... ok, so it was more fun than I'm making it sound.. but it's almost 3:30am, give me a break huh? I got other stuff to get to here. anywho.. (I realize that I run certain risks with what I am about to type, but at this point I'm prepared for whatever consequences may come of it.) we started talking of.. personal interests, ya know, personal "relationship" interests. ya see, she knows who I like, and asked me how things are goin'. I mentioned some of what I wrote in my last entry and some things leading up to it  et cetera...  she said it made her sad to see her friends giving up. I explained a little more on what I personally meant, and the surrounding situation.. " if how she acts changes the way you feel about her, your heart toward her, then it probably is something you should give up 'cuz it's not about her anymore. if not, it's worth holding on to. " (ok I admit, it's a paraphrase, but putting it in quotes causes it to make a greater impact) " it's an attitude " (that  is  a direct quote) love that is.. it's not something affected by what she does/says; how she reacts... I think I've realized that any confusion or frustration comes from my own slefishness desiring some "positive" response to what I do/say. but I still feel the same way about her as I did before. that doesn't change. " it's an attitude " so what does that mean?.. where does it leave me?.. what do I do? pretty much the same thing I've been doing(more or less) mabye just a little better. ;)   Love always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.   amen!  &#13;

       this is me giving in.. in the middle of a knock down drag out fight with life. yeah, life is hard. on the other had I scored a sweet chicago bears hoodie from john tonight. so what if it's too small. it has a great hood. I have bigger hoodies with smaller hoods. WHAAT IS THAT?!?! so back to the insanity that I call my life... I'm trying hard to just give up, not think about it(her). I really don't want to go through something like this again. it's too hard, and it hurts way too much. I know that nothing good comes easy, that the easy road is not the one God intended for us.(at least me)   but gee whiz Wally.. why does it all seem to be "difficult tasks"? learn learn learn grow grow grow broken humbled learn grow learn grow streeeeeetch ouch! lots of lessons and little benefits/reward.. yes yes store up your treasure in heaven where rust and moth cannot destroy, i know, but come on, life isn't meant to be a continuous series of difficult tasks and learning experiences. at least some of it should be enjoyable. I ought to be able to come through times with something... (someone?) it's all too hard for me. yes, too hard for me. God I need you. I'm far too weak for this Lord. far too weak. far too weak...  I don't know how you plan to do anything with me. or even what for that matter. school? are you really suggesting school again? what about all the bills I already have? you gonna take care of them? alright, so if you want me in school, you'll make a way for it to happen, but am I sure where/what? CLC? I'm so tired of that place. I know that sounds horable, but I just don't know if I can get on the inside, or is that not even what I need to do? you talking associates? not bothering with the ba, and the full-time(and all the bs)? harper? oakton? columbia? how involved am I supposed to be in habitat? what is my calling exactly? I don't know, never really have, just trusted you to have me where you want me... sound classes at columbia.. I don't know about that. something that greg suggested.. could be really good, doesn't seem right at present time though. I like the idea of at least taking photography with ted at harper. I think it would be a lot of fun. fricken money sux! I hate it. I need a guitar amp. a computer would be really nice to have. God.. I give up. you gotta do it. I don't care what or how, but please let it be now. PLEASE! I'll just try to be friends. I suppose that's best for now. reveal to me Lord. smack me in the face with it, 'cuz I'm tired and dum. I love you.. Seth&#13;

I will get it fixed.. I will win.  work went by pretty quick today. found out my schedule for the weekend. normal work day tommorrow. well.. I have to be there at 9am instead of 10, but I get done at 4:30.(normal time) I should prolly take a nap after work.. but I will be at souled out. that's a plus.  :)  then back to sleepy-land until... about 2-2:30 so I can be at work about 3am. won't be done then until sometime sunday afternoon.  then I sleep. until when I don't know. I'm glad that I have some time to myself.. and I won't be literally working the whole weekend.  I'm done.. goodnight&#13;

      today was full of God. I had some great conversation with Justin and Shawn. them telling me what's been going on with them.. me sharing a little of what's been going on with me.. it was really good. the three of us prayed at youth tonight during the altar time. it was key. juice even you might say.. well.. shawn had some interesting things to say as he prayed.. God has some breaking to do in me I guess.. I new He was working in me.. that I have things to learn and grow in.. I had kind of overlooked the whole breaking thing up to this point.. anything worth having is going to cost something.. God's gonna fully heal some stuff I prolly thought was already taken care of.. it's gonna hurt at first.. but it will make me stronger and healthier in the end.  I can't worry.. worrying does me no good.. will it add a day to my life or an inch to my height? no, of course not. don't worry seth, don't worry. I gotta start living God's call for my life.. it just seem's so general. no specifics.. ergh.. God you have to do it.. I don't know how. ahhhh.. so much to say.. things I shouldn't write here. that's frustrating. things I want to document, I want to remember, write down for the future, and I can't! God grant me good memory. help me to remember all of this. I doubt that many people actually read this(because I don't think too many people actually know about it) but I guess I'm sort of suprised that anyone would continue to read it.. I'm so vague most of the time that very few would know what I'm talking about at any given moment, and not even them all of the time. whatever. keep reading. sign the guestbook. love God. make your mark. give someone $5. leave 'em wanting more...&#13;

        tug  well first off I want to say what's up to my bro tyler. (while I simultaneously try to remember if I gave him the address or not. I don't remember giving it to him. which makes me curious as to how he got it... not that I don't want him to read it.. just curious.. so how did you hear about my page huh?) thanks for signing the  urlLink guestbook . hopefully others will follow in your footsteps. *hint* *hint*    played some bass at habitat on thursday. it was a lot of fun, and I think worship went fairly well over all. I hope I can get in on that action again. afterward, I went to pick  urlLink jess  up and meet everyone else at Bakers Square. Abdur is the man! don't believe me? check out what  urlLink jess has to say about him.  he is the man! once our hunger was satisfied, and we could stay no longer, mike, matt, jake, jess, and myself went back over to Northwest Assembly. I'm not entirely sure why we went in the first place, but I do know we ended up having dizzy races from one side of the lobby to the other. well, actually I only really tried once, and I got so dizzy spinning I fell over and smacked the back of my head on the floor. *ouch!* (it didn't help that I got hit in the back of the head at work today with a falling 10x14 screen case either...) to be honest, my neck and shoulders have been soar ever since, but it was quite the sight to see I'm sure.  friday.. at the sheridan in arlington heights by 10am. set up the stuff blah blah pretty boring, right? well, as I was heading back up to my van, I GOT STUCK IN THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR!!! how does that happen? I was in there for prolly twenty minutes before two guys from engineering busted the door open. I didn't get to the shop 'til 'bout quarter to 1 in the afternoon. I ended up leaving around 4:45 to go down to the university of chicago. didn't get back in the suberbs until 11:30 or so. here's the kicker though... I had to be back down there at 3:30am to load out. I got two two hour naps this morning. one before load out. and one after load out before I had to be at work (10am) when I got home from work today, I took a wonderfully long/hot shower. it was excellent! souled out was quite good tonight. I have been getting something from every service I've been to there recently. that's not something you can say about everywhere(and of course it's different for different people too) I get to be a part of the intimate fellowship between the Father and the Son. that's really cool. do you realize that Jesus' face was unrecognizable? that's how severely he was beaten... had to pick up the stuff at the sheridan at 11pm tonight. the dude had everything picked up and put away when I got there. all I had to do was haul it to my van and load it in. that's freakin' awesome! I was out by 11:30. met up with jess, ted, joe, and jake at denny's.(ah but not the same one we used to go to(the one at palwaukee) now we go to the one by 53 in Rolling Meadows. it's much better.) that was fun. now here I sit doing my daily routine of checking my e-mail and my friends' online journals. soon and very soon I am going to go to bed.  hug  ;)&#13;

       B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L ! ! ! that sums up what today's weather was. I had to drive down to navy pier for work today. I was sweatin' hard core style. yeah, just ridin' in the van! it felt good to sweat. my left arm got some sun. I think my right arm feels a little left out. it'll deal. so I ran home and showered before habitat. man that was awesome. what a great shower. habitat was good tonight. well.. sorry mat but I missed most of what you were talking about. my mom called and I decided I should talk with her. I got back in just in time to make sure I turned johnny's electric on for worship. *phew* that was close. (thanks G)   I'm going to camp. I just don't know if for both weeks or just one. if I go to one.. it will be the second one.. senior high camp. I passed the idea by my boss this afternoon. I don't think he was real keen on the idea, but I think he'd let me. (go God go) prayin' about it still. I really need to contact John Marx. talk to him about it. yeah..  really  need to do that.  I'm gonna hit the hay early tonight. good night everyone, and God bless.&#13;

         urlLink    which Episode II character are you?      Yoda. Jedi Master. Your word is pretty much gospel, as far as others are concerned. You stick to your roots and have a good head on your shoulders. You can always provide a good response to those in need of answers, or those who just want to talk. You may not look tough, but inside you've got more power than the majoirty of people.   heh.. "must is, must ain't don't sound right" - my dad&#13;

      was nearly quarter to five as I drove by my friends house.. the long way home.. and the blue passed by overhead now entering arlington heights, I pass by chicago .. the long way home.. it hangs in the sky like smoke  actually jess.. I had to go to work.. if home was my destination I would have gladly stayed out much later. and actually as it turns out.. I didn't really need to leave for another hour. I should have known better than to believe my boss when he said it would be over at 1am. ah well.. I get payed for it either way. it was nice to see you one last time, as I did not expect that I would.  things always happen when you least expect them..   so yeah.. I helped load out the aragon tonight (this morning) I suppose my being early helps make up for my lateness this morning(well yesterday now actually)   today is memorial day.. a time when we are to remember those that died to help protect our freedom that we have in this country. I plan on sleeping for some time.. then waking up and going to the beach with some friends. gotta pitch some shoes if you know what I mean. maybe some frisbee will be in order as well. mmm.. I hope that we grill out or something. it wasn't discussed as far as I know, but dang would that be good!    brooke, I'm not sure if you even read this but good luck on the big project you have to work on today. I hope that you get some time to relax and enjoy your day off.  I've been doing a lot of praying and thinking recently about my future. for once I can say that I think I have been doing more praying then thinking. that's a good thing. I guess it really started when justin and shawn came down to visit... and then tim's message on saturday kept me going in the same direction.. well seeking God for direction that is. funny.. as I was loading out the congress this morning.. dan moritz called.. I know I mentioned that before but.. searching God on what to do and * bam * Dan calls and asks if I want to go to camp. I must say that I'm starting to lean towards it. I still have to pray about it, and get the right info from Dan on it.. but it seems right. ya know? the next two years are going to be key. I can just tell.  I've been listening to the gloria record   start here  a lot recently. nothing is actually playing right now.. but that's been in my car cd player almost without exception. i was born in omaha is like my favorite song right now and I can't wait to hear it again.   seeing as it's almost 6am and I would like to get some good rest before traveling off to the beach.. I'll have to be going now.   good night and God bless. :) &#13;

      still no password info.. I arrived at souled out around 8:30 last night.. yeah, I know that's a half hour after it's supposed to start. I was playing my guitar, taking a shower, and writing a goodbye message in a card to  urlLink jess . :( for some reason beyond my grasp I love that girl to bits. now I realize some people that actually read this know both  urlLink jess  and myself, and let me assure you that there is no intention of  that  sort.. she's my sis :) (plus intention of  that  sort rests with another) I'll miss her while she's at camp... 'nuff said.  I was to be at the congress theatre at 6am this morning.. well I wasn't. I had both my clocks set for 5:20.. well I woke up at 7:20 and got to the congress about 8. I was not happy with myself for that. I mean, I slept through two hours of alarm clock! that's just plain ridiculous. I fortunately did not get in trouble for it. *phew* so I worked there 'til 9:30 or so and went off the McDonald's for breakfast.(the rock 'n roll mcdonald's to be exact) john flaws himself bought us breakfast this morning. this made me especially happy since I only had $1 in my wallet. got over to excaliber about quarter after 10 or so.. didn't leave until after 7:30pm tonight! most of the time I was standing there.  just in case  I suppose. I hope I never see stuff like I saw tonight ever again. I came to the conclusion that most guys are perverts. whether they like women or men.. perverts!   yuck!   here's something interesting.. while I was helping load out the congress this morning, Dan Moritz called me. he was wondering if I wanted to go to camp this year.. he knew I'd been there the past couple years.. et cetera.. I didn't talk to him about it much since I was working at the time and was already  two hours late  and didn't want to get in trouble. (since it seems as though I avoided it by the skin of my teeth.. thanks for that one God :)  interesting.. maybe this is some direction for my future.. just maybe...  so now I'm just waiting.. waiting for mike to call and tell me what's going on tonight.. waiting to see if I get a response.. waiting to see if I get a response.. waiting for 1am to roll around when I have to be at the aragon to load out another show.. waiting for some revelation on what I'm supposed to do(perhaps I got a clue to this one this morning.. hmm... ).. waiting.. waiting..  waiting.&#13;

I think I like it.  the bottle was pretty cool last night. the second band was quite good. they're called  the midstates . ok-go was the headliner. they are a good band.. not necessarily my favorite music, but good. I found out about this pizza place that's open 'til 5am! that's exciting to me. good pizza too!   today at work started off busy and fast paced. it then drifted off into the rest of the day. not a bad day all in all. shortly I'll be taking a shower and leaving for souled out. mike's supposed to give me a call when he, ted, and jake are done with accountability. I wonder if we'll do anything tonight?  not sure what's going on tommorrow. I should probably go to living hope, talk with john marx and everyone else that I haven't seen for quite some time now. gotta talk to john about camp. wanna go.. wanna go. tommorrow night I'm not sure about either. *wondering if brooke wanted me to go swing dancing with her tommorrow specifically or just some sunday* *maybe I'll give her a call tommorrow afternoon...*  in the spirit of the test craze that has been going on lately...

      waiting for my hair dye to set. I have to run by the belmont shop and drop some stuff off there, and then I'm off to the empty bottle. elliot is running sound and he said I could come down to check it out. ooh.. I gotta run by the bank too. dang! okay.. gotta hit the showers&#13;

      I think there's something in my room that makes me sick. I felt pretty good going to sleep last night again, and then when i woke up I'm all coughing and soar throat; yuck! eh.. tristan, mary, and edwin were over when I got up. they took off not long after I came upstairs. do you think it was personal?   work at noon today. short day today, woo hoo! I hope things go well at work today. it just make things nice when they do. no idea what's goin' on after work today. I feel like I really haven't talked to the boys all week. monday and tuesday at quencher's, wednesday with daniela and brooke.. I saw them for a short time last night but then had to go work. I wonder if they're doin' anything tonight? I thought will was gonna call me sometime this week.. what did I do with his phone number.. gotta find that.    it feels good to be up well before I need to be at work. I had a bowl of cereal, and I get to take some time on-line. aww.. shizzle.&#13;

      I waaaaaay ti-ewrd..    yesterday was fun. I got down to daniela's 'bout 1:30pm.  we went to the mall and walked around. quite literally that's all we did. I think we only actually went into two stores and stopped for me to get coffee. then we went to threshold where I bought my first ever fugazi  cd. (just so you know.. they do not dissappoint) then her mom fed me (even though I wasn't hungry) it was quite good. I felt bad that I couldn't finish it though. (I wasn't hungry)   then church. apparently the first wed of the month = combined worship and split up the junior high and senior high kids for small groups. it was good. I didn't get to say hi to a couple of people because we had to leave right away afterward to go to the ashbary coffee house for open mic.   the open mic there was very different from the one at quencher's. quencher's you sign up for a spot and play 3 or 4 tunes and your done. ashbary you spread yourself out a bit more. play one or two now.. another later.. a couple after that.. it's cool. lot's of poetry read too. this one kid brought bag pipes.. mad props to that kid! Brooke did a really good job. it seemed as though people liked my stuff.. but I'm not entirely sure if they were just being nice. I think they found it to be somewhat enjoyable at least though.  the ashbary is about a half hour from my house. I went the other way. first to brooke's house to switch over to daniela's car and go to her house. I could have stayed the night there, but I was wide awake, so I figured it would be better for me to just go ahead and drive home.  I'm not sorry for the detour. (thanks daniela :)  your a good friend)   I went to bed feeling good.. but boy did I feel like crap this morning. ugh! I went to work anyway.. and it was fine. about normal I suppose. I got my shure t-shirts today. I was supposed to get them tuesday (I called in sick) john bobeng was good to me. the other guys were rummaging through and he saved me three.   habitat cookout. mmm... good food.  then I had to load out a show. two hours, prolly make $50 for it. not bad. now I'm dead tired though. goodnight.&#13;

      okay.. not much time.. I still have to shower yet and I want to be down at daniela's by 1:00pm at the latest. quick rap up of yesterday:  1\ woke up on time to get ready for work. 2\ called in sick to work /me feel crappy :(  3\ get on-line/chat with daniela/chat with brooke/other on-line stuff 4\ decide I'm going to meet brooke at the fireside at 6pm(I have to be down the street at quencher's at 9:30 anyway.. so should work out well, right?) 5\ 3:30pm lay down to take a half hour nap. 6\ half hour turns into three and a half hours.  DOH!  7\ get ready and get down to the fireside a little after 8pm (what is it with me and being two hours late?!?!) 8\ there for about a half hour/brooke decides to leave/only reason I went/so left as well 9\ walked over to quencher's 10\ walked to van where read and prayed for 20min or so 11\ back to quencher's to wait for eric 12\ help run sound 13\ end up with extra $10 in pocket for helping eric(didn't think I'd get anything.. well I did get free drinks.. I found out I like soda water with lemon.. I think I'll try lime next time) 14\ went home/quick run through of on-line routine/sleep.. ahh sleep.  so that's my day.. pretty much. gotta run &#13;

      welcome back ed. lightning is a gorgeous creation that has the power to entertain, excite, scare, and destroy all in the same instant. I saw some great examples of this wonderful display we call lightning on the way home this evening.. ah yes.. on the way home. I went to quencher's tonight for their open mic night. I went to enjoy and kind of feel the place out for future opportunities. talk about future opportunities! I actually ended up playing a couple rough songs at the very end. my voice was nothing short of dieing on me but it was fun. eric(the guy who kind of heads it up.. a former employee of wcm actually) said that he wanted me to come back next week and play earlier in the night when more people would be around. most certainly. so then I mentioned that I could help out with the sound too if he needed it. *wam* opportunity smacks me upside the head. (praise God. He is so awesome. I love and appreciate Him immensely) looks like I'm on the sub list for running sound there now. (yeah.. woo hoo!) I got his phone number and he introduced me to steve and I gave steve my number so they could get a hold of me. looks like I'll be heading down there tommorrow night(tuesday) to get a grasp on how things work there and where everything is. ( \w/ rock on!) apparently it's some jazzy group tommorrow or something, and it starts 'bout 9:30pm. (sah-weet!) I'm excited. what's funny is I was talking to shawn today (this guy I met through elliot on a windy city show.. he's goin' on tour with converge in a couple weeks to run sound for them. now that's cool.) he was talking about going to some club and talking to the sound guy there and basically getting in like I did tonight at quencher's. sometimes God moves quicker than we expect. I probably wouldn't have said anything to eric about helping out if I hadn't talked with shawn about such thing earlier in the day. man, God's timing is weird/amazing/ perfect . (that really gives me hope for waiting) I'm stoked! got to play some tonight. gonna play some wednesday night at the ashbarry coffee house. get to hang with daniela during the day wed.. go to church (christian hills) see kyle flannigan probably. see brooke. "working" tommorrow night (learning the ropes at least) maybe hanging with will friday night and going to that ihop (international house of prayer ...no not pancakes) extension that's in the area (and if not this friday, then prolly soon at least :)  summer kick off bar 'b que for habitat thursday night. hopefully souled out again this saturday.(I like going there. I always seem to get something from the service) what a great week in store for seth. it makes me quite happy. (and I already talked about going over to chuck's last night after chillin' with dan culp for a while. that was cool too) I need some rest. still fighting off this cold ( or whatever it is.. it sure is annoying!) have a great day and God bless.  ps oh yeah.. almost forgot. looks like from the calender above the bar that there is an open jazz jam (or something like that) on sunday nights. I know some of you like jazz. we shall have to go sometime.  pps I love you.&#13;

       alright.. now that's all done with, I can get on with life; or at least talking about life.. or something?  5 hours on-line  this afternoon that's right  5 hours !!!  I took a lot of tests on  urlLink the spark  and chatted with a few friends. (daniela  urlLink brooke  and  urlLink thad )    looks like I'm gonna go visit daniela on wednesday. yeah.. I've decided to make better use of my days off. instead of sleeping all day I'm gonna do stuff.. yeah stuff. this wednesday.. well I said that.. I'm gonna visit daniela; go to church with her. then I'm guessing we hit up the open mic night at the ashbary coffee house where  urlLink brooke  has been playing every wednesday for a while now I guess. maybe I'll try my hand (or my songs rather) as well.. we shall see.   anyways.. after being on-line all that time.. I decided I should do something a little more human... so I took a shower and drove around for a little bit. tried callin' some people. as usual when I'm looking for something to do,   no one answered their phones  yeah well.. mike called me back right away, so that was cool. I ended up going over to northwest to see if dan was there and what he was up to. it was good to see anne. haven't seen her in a while. apparently it was good to see me. she gave me what I suppose I would describe as a  cat call  when I came walking up. strange. it was kind of flattering.. but  strange  ended up across the street over at photo's. mmm.. double dog.. mmm.. you know barq's root beer is quite good out of a fountain. I highly recommend it. ;)     drove dan home afterward.. well, we drove around for a while; the end of which came to be in front of his house. it was good talking with him again. we haven't done enough of that, and I look forward to doing more of it.     for some reason..    I decided to drive out to  urlLink chuck 's at that point. it was cool. I finally met the infamous miah that everyone has talked about (okay.. maybe not everyone.. but I've heard his name quite a bit in the last week or so)  urlLink hartsaw  was over there too.(he's doin' some rad stuff with the  urlLink star of earendil  page) we watched adult swim of course. I mean what else do you do sunday night between 10pm and midnight.  fuu-nny!  I just may have to make a point to be over there sunday nights from now on.. hmm...  fuu-nny!  left there 'bout 2am.. I figured, " if I gotta go move my van anyway.. I'm just gonna go ahead on home for the night ." so I did, and here I sit at my computer for another logged hour of on-line time. (no I don't actually log my on-line time. that would be kinda funny though, huh?)    I'm thinking of checking out that open mic thing at quenchers tommorrow night that elliot told me about. I'm not for sure decided, but I want to go sometime, and there's not practice for habitat so it would be a good opportunity... we shall see. goodnight. &#13;

      denny's is a horrible thing to waste... wednesday night ted and I realised that we hadn't been to denny's in about 3 1/2 weeks! I know.. it's horrible. we remedied that right off. been to denny's two nights in a row now and it feels good. now I'm not saying we need to go back to 4 or more times a week, but to go off denny's all together is just plain wrong. can I get an amen?  the bosses were gone from work today  :)  habitat went well tonight. I should probably start paying closer attention to the word that is shared.. I don't think I can remember what has been talked about ever. given.. I have a hard time remembering anyway.. but yeah.. I should pay attention.   still need to finalize camp stuff. (come one seth, let's get this done!)  I'm excited! bar 'b que 'n at jake's house tommorrow night. gonna be a good time. yeah.  jeremiah called me tonight. he's a cool kid man. cool kid. sounds like he's comin' along well with the music, and God is gettin' him by financially. look forward to seeing him again.  speaking of people I miss.. I really need to write jess a letter at camp. she's been gone for like three weeks now! I can't believe it.   moving soon. not sure when. not sure where. maybe sunday afternoon. maybe in another week. maybe... I don't know. God please make something work out. thank you.  ugh! more to do.. I still haven't even started packing. I gotta get wedding cards and send 'em to where they need to go. father's day is sunday...   stuff.. yeah stuff.&#13;

       yeah I'm ready to be a rock star. wearing the same clothes in different configurations for days on end; never sure when the next time you'll step into a shower will be.  I've already successfully lived out of my van for a month. (did that when I first moved down here in the fall. crashed on johnny's floor for most of that time) I practice the other two on a regular basis. as of today, I haven't showered for three days now. (oh come on.. it's not that bad. I know other people that do it too. besides, I'm practicing to be a rock star. it's a must) the clothes thing.. well they're mostly clean...   okay.. so I've really only played three times at two different open mics.. and I should finish some more stuff, and maybe get a cover or two ready for filler (in case I gotta play for a long time for some reason.. plus they're just fun sometimes) it's funny. when I saw ryan a couple months ago.. I told him I lived in a family's basement, and that I worked for a sound &amp; lighting company... he asked me if I was in a band. first thing/straight up. it made me chuckle. I asked john if he still wanted me to play bass for him at shows. he said yeah, unless he got charlie to play. wants me to run sound for him wherever he plays. I appreciate his compliment on my sound running skillz(as they are mad to be true); and in some ways I would be a part of the band 'cuz I would "tour" ( I use this term very loosely) with them wherever they went; but it's not quite the same as playing on stage. I don't know if anything will really come of it or not. he wants to play.. whatever.. he prolly won't get charlie any way. I wonder how it will work.. ted being in two bands and all?   I gave avis a ring last night. I was scrolling through my phone book entries and was like, " I wonder what avis is doing.. I haven't talked to her in I don't know when.." she was going out to a movie with someone last night.. but said she'd give me a call today and we'd do something. I think she mentioned that a bunch of people are doing stuff today and that we could get together in a big group and go mini-golfing or something.  it should be fun.   stupid gotta run to accu-trak.. ergh.. stupid stupid stupid.. it's not like I get anything for doing it. not even payed for my time probably. oh well.   .. and we'll have fun fun fun 'til her daddy takes the t-bird away...  &#13;

      so I never got around to the computer lab in the hotel and now I'm at temporary sleeping place number two. someone's house that crystal works with. it seems pretty nice. they have a high speed connection of some sort, so that's a plus. I'm on a mac.. which is cool.. but it's set up to work like a pc and the trackball eats it... I guess I'll just have to live with it. (yeah right)  so I started helping out with sound at heart 'n soul on friday night at the hardcore/metal show. it was a blast. I helped at souled out last night too, so yeah... I may be running sound at the show next sunday night.. brandston/denison marrs/twothirtyeight/element 101/anathello and some other band that I can't remember their name right now. I'm looking forward to that.  I wanted to go swing dancing tonight.. ya know.. for my second time ever.. but I have negative dollars. that's right, I think if I had any less money I would qualify to be my own government. oh well. I will go again. just not tonight.   found out that ted is gonna be home this week. no cornerstone after all. that sucks! rather selfishly, that gives me someone to hang out with this week. hopefully I'll be able to hang out with daniella sometime this week. she's rad.   sometimes I wonder if I annoy some of my friends. I hope not 'cuz I love 'em a lot.   I miss jess. I hope we are able to talk sometime soon. it seems like we always catch one another at bad times. :( one of these times it'll work. :)    I was all nervous and stuff on friday night. no, not cuz of the show.. I had to talk with someone.  I finally did and it was rather anti-climactic. neither of us knew what to say, and I can't say for sure if anything even came out of it. sometimes I just feel kinda helpless when it comes to you. ( i don't know if you even read this.. and you won't be around for a week now anyway) God bless you and keep you safe  so now I'm waiting for ted to call me. he was supposed to call erica and helen to see if they wanted to do something and call me right back. yeah.  I'd like to send a big thank you and much love to heather and mike who have both on seperate occasions in the past week demonstrated their love and concern for me in ways that I appreciate beyond the scope of language.

      thanks for the posts there jeremiah.. I am quite looking forward to hearing this masterpiece you've been working on. I'm nearly peeing myself with anticipation.(or maybe I just have to go really bad) so you like the changing color thing, huh? I'm not sure how I feel about it. It works for now at least.  I don't really have time for any detailed blogging right now.. but I am going to camp next week. I leave tuesday and get back sometime saturday. (that's the plan anyway) I have to work at quencher's tonight, and I'm hoping that it goes well(and hopefully not too late. I want to get up and go to living hope in the morning.. I should go to early service too, so I can get over to northwest.. as I won't be around this week it would be nice to say goodbye to people) yikes!  gotta go.. more to follow..&#13;

       killing myself and dying to know why   I told God that if He wanted me to go to camp then he had to make it easy to change the dates I was taking off. you see.. I had the wrong dates at first, and it know turns out that senior high camp is just next week! amazingly enough, my boss was really okay with it. "that shouldn't be a problem" he said. so I changed the dates I had off in the book and everything is good right? well... I took a look at my bank statement today. I'm in the red a c-note. do you have any idea how much that hurt?!?! so as of right now I have sixty some dollars in my pocket which forty some odd dollars of has to pay for my phone bill before they cancel my service.(which means I gotta get to the mall in the next hour) so I took another show at quencher's. tommorrow. wednesday night. I gotta call dave and tell him I can't run sound. I have to be there at 8:00 it turns out and I gotta make sure habitat is ready. I don't know how it's gonna work but I really need the cash. so I have off for camp, and as far as I know people are expecting me to be there next tuesday. I really want to be there too. the way it came up(me going that is) and how easy it was to switch my dates have to be signs from God. right? so what do I do about my financial situation? whether I end up going or not, I may take another show on saturday instead of going to souled out. that sucks! I really like going to souled out. I really need to make the extra bucks.  what extra stinks about working tommorrow night too is that epd is playing their last ever show and I can't go. well I couldn't go if I wasn't working cuz I'm broke but... ergh!!  I talked to my dad for a few minutes today. it's his birthday. he's now 52. I'd say he looks quite good for his age too. I told him I didn't know if I could really go to camp next week. (what with missing the week of work) he said that he wondered the same thing, and thinks it would be better for me to not go and work. "sometimes you gotta do" I love my dad a lot and appreciate what he has to say. some small part of me thinks God will make it work if I go. but I'm really struggling with it right now.  I found out I had the wrong dates last friday when I was talking with my mom. I was upset, cuz I really wanted to go and I didn't think my boss would let me off for the right dates. she told me that if God wanted me to go he would make it work. he made the days off work.. he could make the money work right? of course he can. but does he really want me to go? I feel like I'm giving up if I just don't go. not like something I just wasn't able to do (like going to epd's show tommorrow) but like I'm giving up short of where I'm supposed to be and what I'm supposed to be doing. It's all so difficult to discern right now, and my being tired is only compounding the difficulty.  I am so blessed to be staying with the family I'm staying with. I haven't bought food for a couple few weeks now, and crystal hasn't said a word. amber made a crack about it today, I think cuz she was hungry. anyway, God bless them a lot!  what am I supposed to be doing anyway? if it wasn't for God's grace and Crystal's leniancy/giving heart there is no way whatsoever I could be down here right now. "home" again is not where I want to be. for quite some time now I've never really had straight answers for what I want to do, where I want to go, life goals, plans, vision... as of late I've started feeling like I need to get some. before it was okay.. like I didn't need to worry about it.. and I don't feel like I need to be worrying about it (worrying is no good, can I add an inch to my height or a day to my life? no) I'm just starting to feel like I need to do something about it. I've got a crap load of bills and other like things that need to be taken care of.. I've been to school off and on for 6 years now since high school with no degree to show for it. I'm not really sure that I need one.. but I need to do something. feel like I'm getting somewhere. like I have purpose, and I'm fulfilling it. God help me please.  I met this interesting guy last night. his name is dusty. he was talking to me about music and what he wants to do with it and what he thought of my stuff and my playing, and it was pretty cool. I ended up giving him a ride home. I was kind of debating on whether or not I should and I just felt a tugging like I should. I prayed that somehow I could share God's love with him (or something like that at least, I don't remember exactly what I said) I'm not sure if I followed through on it. we ended up getting something to eat at this little diner. funny, when we left I was reminded again that for some reason non-christians seem to be a lot more giving with their money than we as christians are. and he wasn't the only person that has reminded me of that since I've started at quencher's. people are always bummin' each other smokes or buyin' someone a beer, and dusty bought me breakfast. and left prolly a 30% tip on top of it. why can't we be that giving? something to not just ponder, but do something about. I'm thinking I may have opportunities in the future to share with dusty... I just have that feeling.  time to be off to pay my phone bill. I think I'll try to call jess. yeah. big day with joie tommorrow. I'm looking forward to it. God bless.   ...and I feel that far away &#13;

       picking it up where I left off...    I picked up jess.. her dad liked my clothing ensemble apparently.. my combination of a cheerleading shirt and a white belt was what did it.. :)  we drove to the mall so jess could exchange some lotion for something she liked the smell of better. I learned the difference between lotion and cream.. (cream has avocado oil in it so it feels a little greasier, but is much more moisturizing) .. then to heart 'n soul. moved stuff.. set up stuff.. sat around.. said hi to the guys from brandston.. then the show. it was excellent. well aside from some feedback issues, and the fact that you couldn't hear the lead singer from element 101 to save you life.. but other than that it was really good. it was cool to be able to mix for 238 and brandston.. I helped out with the others but joie was the lead for denison marrs and embodyment.. good show.   one kind of weird point.. jess says this doesn't make me a dork, that just me as myself am one, but anyway.. I half wondered if she would show, but I really didn't expect it, and when I saw the car and realized whose it was.. fluttery nervousness. I wanted to run and hide. but I didn't. maybe you read this. maybe you don't. maybe I'm just a big dork. you still love me anyway?  my brother and shawn came down with alice and someone else.. I don't remember who.. well.. yeah.. it was good to see 'em.  jess and I took off right after the show.. actually embodyment was still playing (we ran pretty late with the show.. as usual.) I left my guitar in the hands of brooke, and rode like the wind. after a stop at taco bell and a little turning around because taco bell distracted me from my turn it was a non-stop trip to camp manitoqua. we listened to the new anathallo cd and jess fell asleep. well it would have been non-stop, and we would have made it by midnight, but just as I turned down 30(about 5-10 from the camp) up came the lights behind me. after a brief explanation of mount prospect and wisconsin id's and camp curfews(which I think was our saving grace) the police officer was nice enough to let us proceed without a ticket (even though I was cruisin' a hefty 15 over down la grange). praise God my lord and savior. as we drove on and the cop turned around I just started laughing.. so close, we would have made it. that's the second time God has been faithful in the past month or so.. jess was prolly five minutes late for curfew. fortunately the doors weren't locked yet.   after jess showed me where my head would rest that night, she went off to her room. I read for a while and had a most restful sleep. now I'm not sure if I actually woke up before jess came in this morning or not.. I think I did once, but I'm really not sure 'cuz after going back to sleep (if indeed I did wake up) I dreampt(dreamed??) that I woke up (and I know I was dreaming 'cuz when I did wake up the windows in the room were different.. and the room was shaped a little differently as well) now I've never really looked into dream analyzation or anything.. but I know that in america's sweethearts they say that when you dream about bread it represents something you can't have. I realize that's prolly not the best place to get info like that from.. but that's my background and I think perhaps God was telling me something. I don't think I'll go into all of it here. I imagine that fewer than six people will hear the actuals of this dream, and I apologize for the carrot, but those who should now will know, and may even ask me about it. you all know who you are. oh.. and don't be so sure of yourself right away. try to wrap your mind around it after you read this..  it wasn't her .    the word of the day is still wait. &#13;

      visiting jess with ted was soo much fun. aside from being generally ridiculous, we were able to just sit and talk some as well. always time well spent with either of these two good friends. found some good buys as unique thursday morning.  incubation and embryology   ha! alas.. jess had to be off to the sox game, so ted and I drove home where we hung out the rest of the day. (well.. in the home area at least)   friday was pretty dull. ted and I went to frontier days with erin and her friend kelly where we proceeded to be bored out of our skulls. oh well, not all girls can be as exciting as jess.  after work saturday I went to breanna sanders wedding. well that's not her last name anymore... whatever. I got there just in time to see them kiss. (better than cable according to justin) I got to see pat and gail and david and renee and the butchers and sanchez's and of course my family. I didn't expect to stay around for the entire reception but I didn't end up leaving 'til 8:00. ted wanted to get some sleep and jess was hanging out with mark, so since I had nothing else to do and no one to pick up I went on down to quencher's. it was a pretty good time. the guitar was nearly deafening, so it was a bit difficult to match the vocal level to it, but I did my best and I think it went okay.    so I slept in this morning at ted's house. had a good time reading the word and praying. it's nice to just sit and do that without much concern for time or anything. now I'm just trying to see what time I need to be at the building today for the show.  and I'm out...&#13;

       prolly my last post before camp..   I'm not really sure where this is going so we shall see what transpires. I am now for sure going to camp. I leave tuesday, late morning time.   YAY CAMP!!!  I am soo looking forward to camp this year. I just have a feeling that God wants to do some stuff. It's exciting. plus I don't know how it's all going to work out financially and all, and putting my faith in God about it is somewhat exhilirating. so I went to living hope this morning to talk with jon marx about camp. got forms to fill out and take with me on tuesday.. I'll probably be a counselor, but if for some reason they don't need me to do that I'll most likely end up doing daytime security. I guess that will keep me quite busy during the day... as long as I have time to work on my music and talk with friends I'll be okay. not that those are the reasons I'm going.. I'm just hoping to have time to do them. I'm glad I don't have to do the computer stuff there. I would have done it if I had to, but it's not really my strong point anymore and I imagine it would have been high stress and low free time. God works things out. yeah he does. I love him for that.  I went on a mission for shampoo/conditioner and flip flops after lunch. (which thanks to cal, susan, and charlie was free to me. God bless them for that) I didn't realize that it would be so hard to find flip flops in the summer time. I checked old navy, pay less, wal mart, target, marshalls, tj maxx, and walgreens... walgreens was the most promising, but they didn't have my size. grr.. all I want is a pair of flip flops for camp.. is that so much to ask? I really don't think so. I'll try again.. perhaps tommorrow.. I gotta find more wal-greens to check. I tried two so far.. tommorrow.. tommorrow..  went over to the intern house to meet up with dan. had a cool conversation with cynthia. we've only known each other for a relatively short time, and hadn't really talked before. it was way kewl.  said goodbye to a bunch of people tonight. (cuz I'm goin' to camp yo) looking forward to a good week. keep me in your prayers.. later.&#13;

      camp was definitely good. I have some stuff to sort through from camp though.. so I don't know how much I can really write about it right now. it was good, God is working, I'm still learning (and waiting.. everything in God's timing)  lack of funding.. heh.  novemberish.. that should give us plenty of time to work something up. I need to work on music more. I don't spend enough time developing it.    I sat down hoping I'd be able to write some stuff.. but things just aren't flowing today. I gotta go..&#13;

      howdy hey i'm sure you'll post how camp went so i won't ask. other than that whats going on? same ol' lack of funding here. i'm thinkin' about selling my car in order to have some cash in my pocket (well not really but the thought did go through my mind).  i'm definately ready to get back to where the action is! hey, lets (sooner or later...novemberish?) put something together for one of those open mic nights eh? yeah that would be cool.  so there you have it an email for your blog...i didn't feel like opening my email up so since i was logged in i thought i'd do this instead.  peace \w/&#13;

      a very merry un-birthday to me, to you  way too much money going out. nine dollars at lunch. fifteen dollars at dinner. another ... well i got the student rate at the movie.. so 6.50 there.. and the fifteen was at gino's east for john's birthday.. so I don't regret that either.. I have a horrible tendency to spend too much on lunch at work though. if I don't go in to work, I usually don't even eat lunch. ugh..   work was mostly good today.. we should really put our noses to it when the bosses aren't there though to show we can do it and prove we don't need them around. we didn't today though.. that's for sure. it was just grep, alex, and myself (john took off for his birthday) we sat in the front of the store a lot. I think the first time we really did any work was when we were eating lunch we had to stop to get a rental together. heh. the last 45 min or so of work was kinda hectic. randy finally showed up and kinda rattled things a bit.. but whatever, right?    mike forgot his pin number. lol. poor mike. it'll be worked out tommorrow morning sometime.   it was fun going out for john's birthday. we got him to make use of his new age. don't worry. no one had more then one. "bring me another one of these"  I gotta be up around 8am to be at work by 10 so i think I'm gonna skedaddle..  "I'm from holland. isn't that weird?"&#13;

      ...and with a new determination he sets out to find that everything around him is as it was before.. but not allowing himself to be discouraged he states, "I will do it."  I will do what? habitat was good tonight.  I had to press through worship for a little bit. Jake started playing just the chorus and ending to love song by third day.. something started to stick. I ended up sitting on the floor with tears dripping as from a slow leaking faucet, which continued on into the next song. at some point I found a sense of determination rise up within me.. "I will do it" I think this is in response to another statement I found myself saying once.. it was at camp just however long ago that was.. wed night it was.. I was sitting there well into the altar time.. most people had left.. with my head on the back of the pew.. just sitting there.. I didn't know what to do.. as I was sitting there, dino came up and sat down in the row behind, and just rested his hand on my shoulder.. slowly I started breaking down.. it felt kind of like an emotional dump if that makes sense.. (not that kind of dump so much... well... maybe) I got to a point where I was saying, "why does it have to be me?" "all I've ever wanted is a simple life" "why does it have to be me?" and I cried and cried til.. I think I still had, and probably still have more to cry yet.. but it sort of subsided at least. so yeah..   life as it is right now is pretty crappy. I mean.. things are good, in that nothing is really bad right now.. but things just aren't very fulfilling.. I'm not finding myself in places I can really grow right now. I realize it's up to me to put forth the effort and take the repsonsibility for my own relationship with God.. and I know I haven't really excelled in that area..    I just feel like I'm stuck.    I'm making hardly enough to get by on.. partly even mostly because I find myself in a pit of debt with bills that I don't even always pay every month.. somehow I think to myself that if I can just get to my next pay check it'll get better.. I've yet to find  that  miracle pay check.   ministry.. well well, I run sound for three, that's right, three different ministries at two different churches. fym (youth) and habitat (young adults) at nwaog, and I started helping at souled out not too long ago. to be perfectly honest, I'm getting a little fed up with running sound at fym and even at habitat. fym just seems to be a hassle most of the time, and it doesn't feel like I'm really doing anything for habitat. I only had 1 microphone running through the board tonight.  ONE!!!  I've been considering leaving fym for a while now.. but there's no one else to really do it, and I don't want to just leave without there being someone else who can take over. part of me thinks there won't be until I leave and it forces someone to step up and take over.. I just hate to do it that way unless I know from God that's how it must be. habitat is just frustrating as far as being a part of it goes. the services can be good.. but I don't really feel like I'm a part of something that's moving growing et cetera... maybe it's all just me, and I gotta straighten some things out.. I just feel like there's nowhere else for me to go there. it really sux! souled out is interesting. I mean.. it was almost accident that I started helping there at all.. I'm glad I did, cuz if no other reason I started talking to cynthia some.. she's a cool girl, a rad chick if you will and I enjoy hanging out with her.  but as far as ministry goes.. I'm not sure that I'm really supposed to get any more involved there. they're going to be starting a young adult church on sunday mornings this fall sometime, and it intrigues me... I'm very interested to see what happens with it. it's exciting.. and so are the things that cynthia has talked about wanting to do.. it's exciting.. I want them to succeed, and I'm interested to see what happens.. does it go beyond that? I don't know. does it lead to God's will for me right now at this point in my life? I'm not sure I'm feeling a call for it.. but I'm very interested.. very. and ya know what's weird? I got online at work today.. headed on over to  urlLink 4amblue  and on into ryan, chuck, and jon's personal pages.. now I must admit that I heard a couple/few times this past week that jon is going to denmark.. but thought it was just a short trip.. maybe a month.. well he's leaving for  9 months  in less than a month. and my interest was sparked a little more for what might take place with the young adult church, and the worship team that will lead..  it's all so uncertain right now.. a person here, a person there; a group here, a group there; a church here a church there... but God.. you gotta work some financial miracles for me here.. I'm gonna try to be faithful with my money and tithing and giving and and and... please make good on me not being at a lack of resources.. I know that isn't exclusive to money.. but I could sure use some of those kind of resources about now.  girls.. well.. girl.. uhh.. you know what's funny? when I was really seeking God at camp.. trying to figure stuff out.. and I saw her pressing in after God.. I was never so happy ever.. never so wanting to find God's will for my life ever.. never so attracted to someone ever.. and never so easily hurt by what was done, or not done.. jess and davie can attest to the pain I bore that saturday night. I'm not too proud to admit I cried. though i may seem like a sally or something to some.. and I can only imagine what she might think if she read this..(I don't know if she ever does, but I'm bein' honest here) really I have no idea. I found out she started her own online journal.. (that's what I stumbled on to last night).. I left a comment to one of her entries.. I'm guessing she'll know it was me, though I signed with only an initial.. " love  s " I wonder what she thought about that.. as I'm sure she found it by now, though no response has issued forth as of yet. heh.. someone made the comment that I like jess the other night when I said something about having to call her.. I love jess.. she's my sister ("no she's not" "well I call her my sister") we talk about stuff. it's good. but liking her is not allowed. and even aside from it not being allowed.. I like someone else!  I think as far as girl goes...  maybe I'll just stop there. &#13;

      seems like everyone is getting fed up with things at windy city.  everybody gets annoyed with everyone else. I think it wouldn't be nearly as bad if we had some work to do. if we had stuff to do then we would all be busy and not have time to complain about other people not doing anything. it's just frustrating right now. plus it's really hard to justify asking for more money when in all honesty I know that we all spend most of the day sitting around complaining about work rather than actually doing anything.   jess comes home this weekend. :) she only gets to be here for a week and a half, and then she has to be off for auditions at isu. it'll be nice to see her again though, even for only a short time.  heh... john still doesn't realize...  heh  I gotta figure stuff out. ugh! guess I gotta put the prayer time in. it's hard to sit myself down and dig in. hasta happen though. it must! something good is gonna happen. everything in God's timing.&#13;

      last post.. the 3.. today.. the 12.. supposed to go see sleeping at last and the violet burning tommorrow night. I think john bobeng is going to spot me the funds for it. what a nice friend. I gotta somehow get there from work though and technically I'm not off of work until 30 min after the show starts. suck! hopefully something will work out. I'd love to see the violet burning.. maybe I won't though and that'll be okay. I've got like 19 dollars to last me until thursday after work and a lot of things to take care of once I get paid. ugh!   jess leaves wednesday for isu. it'll be sad to see her leave again so soon. she's only been home for about a week but she just seems such a part of everything it'll be weird for her not to be here. :(  slept through church this morning. I've been pretty good about going the past few weeks.. today just didn't happen. I played my guitar some this afternoon. started working on something new I kinda like. we'll see what happens with it. went over to stephen sandoval's for his going away party. it was good. it's kinda weird how much I'm a part of souled out. I don't really understand it.. or even know how much a part of it I am.. it's kinda cool.. but I don't quite get it.   saw daniela last night for the first time in... it has to be at least 2 1/2 months. :)   souled out was really good last night. really good. love. mike handler spoke at northwest tonight. really good. I remembered about 6:20. (20 min after service starts) I was there for the tail end of worship and got to hear everthing mike had to say. really good. love.  girls are weird.  at chuck's right now. it's been a pretty good time. watched some adult swim. ate some taco bell. did some catch up (ketchup.. catsup.. ketchup.. catsup) on internet stuff. (hadn't been on for nigh on a week)    got some work ahead of me.  love.&#13;

      I got a lot of praying to do, and I'm not really sure how to go about it. yeah that sounds pretty dum, right? not knowing how to go about praying.. I just feel like I once knew how and have forgotten.. bah!   possibilities. in some ways I feel like I have lots.. in others.. dead ends.  it seems as though ministry ops are a plenty.. and actually increasing.. work.. some ways good.. windy city sucks.. whatever.. money is tight.. :P God will provide. he said he would. souled out.. habitat.. good things.. good things.. how much and to what extent? those are my questions.. ???   I gotta start writing here more again. it's good. working on a new song.. hope it turns out well.&#13;

      ugh!  I drove down into the city for what appears to be little reason whatsoever. after twenty minutes of driving around trying to find a place to park, I clicked on the emergency flashers, double parked and ran in to see what the scoop was.  all this to find out that they had been trying to call steve (the guy I was supposed to be filling in for) for the past three or four days to tell him they didn't need anyone to run sound tonight. what a smack in the face. burned much precious fuel to get down there and not make the 75 dollars I though I was going to be making tonight. the bar keep offered me a consolitory drink for driving down there, so I tried an amstel light and gave him my phone number in case they needed someone in the future. yes.. all while my van was precariously double parked at the entrance to an alley running behind the bar.   back to the burbs I headed with the thought that maybe I could at least get a hold of someone and do something tonight rather than just sitting at my house thinking about how I didn't make that much needed 75 dollars tonight. I actually just heard back from ted.. he and jake are playing pool at quentin corner. I passed, since I should really reserve spending any money, and ted is going straight home afterward so he can get some sleep.   my great rescuer has just called now. I'm headed over to the intern house to meet up with jess and do something. yay! I didn't tell you.. I was soo suprised when she came walking into northwest last night after habitat. unfortunately I was headed out to quencher's at the time to make some kiz-ash. definitely brightened my evening though.   and he's off...&#13;

      apparently there are people who actually look at my page on a near daily basis. amazing! sorry for the delay in posting.. between work, church, and the computer being where the rest of the fam sleeps.. I've been neglecting my precious people. for that I apologize. I have to be in the city in an hour to run sound at the underground lounge. (it's south of the metro on clark, for anyone who cares) it'll be my first time there, so I want to be early.. but I still have to shower, and I wanted to write something here to state what I've been up to and how I'm doing. things are going fairly well.. man.. it's been over a week since I last posted. that sux! we'll see how I feel when I get home tonight. God help me to be early for work in the morning. gotta run.. talk to you all soon. :)&#13;

      far too many days between posts.. I gotta get the computer downstairs fixed so I can internet from down there at almost anytime I want. (that's right.. I used internet as a verb)   work is.. well.. I don't think I want to get into it right now.. frustrating.. I'll leave it at that. I may have an opportunity to have a standing sound gig every friday night though. that would be cool. one more night that I can't do anything else.. but better than $200 a month extra for doing it. plus more experience running sound which brings more opportunities in the future. Monday and tuesday this past week at quencher's.. monday and wednesday next week. praise God.. I can sure use the extra cash. aside from bills I want to get some things straight in my room (the basement) which will require, not a ton, but a little bit of money. hopefully if things stay this busy with sound gigs.. I can save up to get some more equipment (music and sound) and maybe actually keep all my bills current. (including my car payments I owe my parents which I've been unable to pay the past two months)  gotta work with john on saturday came too soon stuff.. we're gonna have a show soon and I don't know his songs. I'm not worried, it should be fun. I have his crate amp over here now.. I shall have to play with that.. ooh.. bigger problem with scts stuff.. I don't have a bass or an amp.. hello local pawn shops and e-bay.. I need one cheap.  alright.. I need to shower.. then I'm off to hang with jeremiah.. later all&#13;

      appears that  urlLink mr. handler  has gotten himself a journal now. the number without is quickly being outweighed by the number with. just so long as this doesn't replace actual conversation it's all cool.  good service tonight at souled out. mr. ed talked about.. I forget the word he used.. it's like our mission or purpose in life.. and how everyone's is different from anyone else's. it was cool. I think it's sounding better in there all the time. still have some work to do with the systerm though. it'll get there sometime.  went to the new dunkin donuts/baskin robbins/togos on rand near target.  ice cream is good. unfortunately the people working there really only know donuts.. so they are a little slow. it'll come.  okay.. I'm really tired.. and need to get some sleep.. it's gonna be a long day tommorrow I fear. g'night everyone.&#13;

      I'm sitting about two feet lower than I usually do on a matress next to a sleeping five year old who's room is being painted. the fumes about knocked me off my feet when I came in the door.   jeremiah and I worked on this rad new song for a couple hours tonight. we have a great framework set down, and I think we're mostly done. he said he was gonna start layin' it down this week and hopefully I will be able to come over sometime this week to add my vocals to it. he'll probably just do all the guitar stuff. I wonder if he liked what I was playing for the verse? it's not difficult anyway. I got to hear a bunch of his stuff the other night that he's been putting together for his cd. it's really cool. I think he's gonna put this new one on there too, which aside from travis meeks, will make me the only additional artist mentioned.. hehe ;)    man.. the fumes are giving me a headache.. I may pass out soon if I don't get down to my room.. g'night all.&#13;

      I've gotta lot to spill.. unfortunately I can't really talk about all of it right now. suffise it to say that I, in addition to my bills and direction for the future(present) have another thing I'm praying for. I suppose it sort of goes along with direction.. probably in a huge way.. but that's really all I can say. I'm praying about it.   jeremiah is now officially 21. a few of us went to the loft about midnight to celebrate his birthday. twas fun twas fun.  God bless this guy. he confirmed some things I was thinking. plus we're working on some music stuff. very cool.   \w/ broadway \w/  still waiting to talk with ted. got tied up with things last night. almost falling asleep at the wheel tonight. tommorow is the promise. ted tends to make good on his promises.  I'm really missing talking to jess right now. the past couple days when I've been on-line.. she hasn't. maybe I'll try to call her sometime soon. this internet thing is cool but it's just not the same as a real conversation.  I really need to be sleeping right now.. but I have to much running through my head. suck! well.. it's good stuff..it's just I need to be sleeping...  got some cool stuff coming on the guitar.. perhaps I'll try to read for a little bit and then attempt sleeping again. I can't be late for work.. gotta be on high alert in that concern. God.. I love you.. teach me, lead me, reside with me...&#13;

      first things first..  God is good. I love him a lot. here's a couple of the most recent reasons...  1) my mom is doing much better. she's actually home now. she is a little frustrated with my brothers..(take the hint if you read this to make extra effort in helping out) but she's home. :)  2) Margaret. :) (she's my girlfriend now ya know)  3) though I was home because my mom was sick.. I was able to spend some time with my brothers, which was cool. I wish I had been able to talk with dad some more.. but he's been soo busy lately. I hope he's getting enough rest.  4)  saturday came too soon  first ever show.. Friday October 4, 2002 at Roselle United Methodist Church. I'll get the actual address posted up here. show starts at 8.. (doors.. 7:30) (for those that don't know.. scts is John Bobeng   Ted Leonteos  and myself  it's gonna rock!  okay.. I gotta get ready for work so I can be there on time.. I'll try to get to this more again..I'm trying..&#13;

I may attempt to write out some stuff tonight.. at my parents house in  wisconsin.. I'll leave this short.. but the reason I'm going is to see my mom 'cuz she's in the hospital right now.. any prayer would be appreciated.. I have to get a shower and pack a bag so I can take off.. much love...  &#13;

      has it really been a whole week since I wrote.. dang! well.. my birthday was yesterday. it was pretty good. work was kinda draining.. but I left early came home took a shower and got myself all dolled up. that's right complete with shirt tie and jacket.. I was stylin' I took a change of clothes for afterward though. white t-shirt jeans and of course my chucks. I forgot my belt(the one with the whale buckle) but I got by okay.   Margaret planned this whole thing.. it was so sweet of her. well first she got me another black sweatband(this one has a star on it) and some blacklight bracelets with a manly pink card. but after habitat she had bought a cake and ice cream and gloria's mom had done the same for her(her b-day is today) it was soo nice. after I got my van loaded for my show tonight Margaret gave me my "real" gift. she bought me a toaster oven. she is amazing. never had I specifically said that I wanted one for my birthday but she picked it out because of a conversation we had. talk about well thought out. I must have the best girlfriend ever.  so yeah.. john ted and I have a show tonight at the fishbowl coffee house (206 rush st. roselle illinois.. roselle united methodist church) it's gonna be a lot of fun. looks like a lot of people are coming out to see us play. what great friends we have!  I have some stuff to take care of so have a great day everyone.. God bless.&#13;

      such support i get from my friends. yeah.. it's completely different from what I'm doing now, but from what I'm told I can make good money as a claim adjuster. and since I'd be working for an insurance  company, I'm sure I would get some good benefits. I just gotta get out of this place. I can't take being here for a much longer. on the bright side, it looks like it won't be a problem for me to have monday dec. 23 off as well as christmas eve. that means I can be in WI the whole weekend. I'll probably stay to see the play at nwaog sat the 21, and leave either late that night or early on the 22. I'll miss Margaret, I know. but it will be okay. we decided today that we'll celebrate christmas on the 26. that works out well since it's our 3 month anniversary that day. it's so boring at work today. there's not really anything to do. I'm sure I could "find" something to do, some "menial" task that some 16year old monkey could perform more than sufficiently. what a waste of my time. God, I hope this claim adjuster thing works out, and that it's something I can take pleasure in doing. I need to lose some weight too. it looks like a swallowed an elf for crying out loud! I think the main thing is I need to stop drinking so much pop. it's so bad for me. let's go through the different jobs I've had...  renk corn detassler 3 days seasonal cornfest(manual labor, runner) 3 times seasonal warming house supervisor 3 mo seasonal bike shop(mechanic) 3 wk poor work environment, wasn't taught needed information/sufficiently grocery bagger and stock associate 3 yr left for school library 1 yr stopped attending platteville lemstone(retail sales assoc) 3 wk nsf busse car wash(vacuumed cars) 6 wk nsf office max(sales assoc, sales clerk) 7 mo went home from school(school year ended) mccullough(office staff) 1 1/2 yr moved old navy(retail sales assoc) 9 mo went home from school(school year ended) windy city(shipping manager, rental assoc, manual labor) 15mo nsf, poor working environment, not taught sufficiently to do job with excellence ??? claim adjuster ???&#13;

      It's nice to have a day off.  I'm going down to navy pier with margaret and a couple of friends to see libido funk circus. it's this band margaret saw a couple years ago and really wants me to see them.  memorial day was good. lots of food and drink and time spent with good friends; always a good experience.

      starting over has become a new pastime for me.   in some form or another I seem to be...  starting over with margaret. starting over with God. starting over with my band. starting over with music. starting over with on-line diary-dom. starting over with a new address. starting over with friends I haven't talked to in too long. trying to start over with a new job. not having any luck.(though that may be changing. please God make it clear) and I always seem to be starting over with my finances.  ...hopefully I can learn to keep on and stop taking a mulligan on everything over and again.&#13;

         Ok, random thought of the day:      How do you make peanut butter? I mean, do you put butter and peanuts in a blender and mix? I wanna know...........Cuz when you put peanuts in a baggie and crunch them up, then eat them, it's ALMOST the same thing................. I wonder................... &#13;

Come and wash my hair!" ...no one came... \/ \/ Then I went outside and was walking on top the snow. I was like "O! Look at me! I'm an elf! Walking on the snow! I'm a beast! ...geez I sound like Destinie. Okay, going back to being kim!" Then I fell into a hole and snow went up my pant legs &gt; &#13;

      gah, sorry guys I got backed up &gt;  Dest's dream: Well at least I'm noticed missing. you see me and Bakura were uh.."cleaning" the supply closet for Mrs. Swann...yeah *cough* -^ ^-  Yami: Yami or Yugioh is a thousand years old pharoh from Eygpt. Back then, they used magic to have battles with monsters as fun. the loser lost his life (thats always fun). but then the monsters started to get out of hand because of a magical demention called the shadow relem. here, the monsters actually came to life. to seal way the shadow relem, yugioh trapped himself and others into 7 "melenium objects". Now, several people have possion of these objects. when yugi needs help with the duel monster cards, yugioh takes control of his body.He's called yami because its the jap. name for dark. Yami also calls yugi hikari (light) or aibou (companion). so basically, Yami isa spirit thats takes control of Yugi in times of danger.  Janine: Hun, you are in the reality bound comic but you are not part of the crew. The Group is the basic cast and crew. Answer this: Do you sit at the third table in the CCSA caf. at lunch time, at 11:10 everyday? No? Then you arn't in the crew.  Piccy of Janine: Very nicly drawn Dest! You keep getting better at drawing anime us :) wee.just in case anyone is wondering where i am, i had a doc. appointment. he still isn't too sure about me going to school &gt;  &#13;

      O_O;;; Okay, Yugioh is a schizo so when his little magical thing errupts, this big tall guy with the same hairdo appears and his name is "Yami" or something like that. His voice gets deeper too, it's weird. Omg, I was playing the Two Towers video game and the actors do the character's voices. (he he he) Oh yeah, and Janine is always like, "where's me? I wanna be in the RBcrew picture" and I'm like, "You're not in the crew. The crew is the group" and she doesn't get it!! GRRRR! What is her problem! Someone explain it to her! I will draw her tribute and post it here but she needs to realize she is not in the GROUP!!  Hey David, did you finish the quiz yet? :) &#13;

      I am so bored. I want school. &gt;D I had this weird dream...   So I was walking down a dark alleyway at about four in the morning. I was walking along side of Joey and Yugi was to his right. I was dressed in a robe, laced with gold with a bunch of gold chains and cloth underneath. Joey, was clad all in black with the same. Yugi, was well, Yami. Three people blocked our way up ahead and I couldn't make them out until the moon shined down on them and I noticed it was Yami Bakura, Marik, and some guy in a turban. Marik, who looked very mad, said something that I could not understand and a big moster appeared. It was Obelisk the Tormentor or something like that. Yugi's pyramid began to glow and the monster was all sucked up. Then, Marik, Looking even more pissed off, sent out a big, golden gryphon thing. I wipped out some Jackie Chan, Tossing aside the robe and sid some flips and stuff. Then I swung this big, gold staff that I had and the gryphon got sucked up. I smiled. Then Marik was really really really mad and he sent out an invisible moster that began to chase me. I was scared. I ran to a corner then Joey kicked a paint can full of blue paint. I then saw the feet that looked like elephant feet and then I swung my staff and electricity ran out. Then, a big bolt of lightning shot down from the sky and killed the monster. I looked around the corner and the police were coming! So I ran and was like, "The police! The police!" The two other people ran away but Bakura was like, "Quick! Follow me!" So we climbed up on a roof and flattened ourselves out and laid there. Then one of the officer's looked up and was like, "I see you, come down" (Meanwhile, two kids were running around screaming, 'Yo Trabajo! I'll get you!') "We're not the bad guys." I told him. "I know." We all began to walk away when Bakura was like, "Come here, look" And pointed to our staffs. (Joey's red, Mine gold; we had left them up there) And he said, "I could take them if you'd like." I gave him a sideways glance and uttered, "Noooo." We worked our way to school. When I finally got to school, the teachers were lined up at the doors talking about the "electric storm" so I stopped by my spanish teacher and asked her about if she saw the electric storm. She said, "No, I was taking care of my ferret." So Joey decided to run off (meanwhile, I'm still holding his staff in a plastic shoprite bag.) I went to look for him, when someone told me we had a half day. I seriously needed to look now, so I went into the cafeteria and called for him, he didn't come. Sighing, I walked away to board the bus. The bus was driving away when I ran and jumped into the bus (still holding the staffs) and I began to fall asleep because I was tired. I had spanish homework in my lap and the kid was like, "Hey! Don't stare, look, you're doing your spanish work wrong! That is nosotronamos!" I glared and thought, no way that is nosotrosamos! Outside, someone was flagging me down going, "I FOUND JOEY!" I jumped out of the bus and ran into the school where I saw David and Assia. "Hey!" David cried. "Have you seen Joey?" I asked them. "No." They said. "How about kim?" "No." They said. Sighing, I noticed that the bus was leaving. I asked TK if I could use his cellphone so he handed me a yellow remote. "You have to press this, this, this this this and this, to get it to go. Then you press the number and then press this, this this and this!" I put in the number but it was wrong. I tried to press the buttons in sequence to get it to work, but I did it wrong. Then I remembered that Joey and I were going to WALK home so I didn't need to worry. (Though my school is 40 mins away from my house) Then, while I was walking down the hallway, I saw Yami Yugi. "Have you seen Joey?" I asked. "I looked in the cafeteria, he wasn't there." Yugi said he didn't and I was sad and then...   I woke up. &gt;. &#13;

      O_O; Thanks. Did you guys notice I'm adding the gallery here? Blahh!  Kim, I redid your picture (by the way, I loved it, it was so cute) I colored and I couldn't fit everyone on there, I draw too big. GNOMIE'S A PIMPIN' CAT!! Woo! The first thing janine said to me was, "Where's me?!?!" I had to explain she's not in the "group". *sigh* 'tis what you get once you add a minor character, don't you agree??  I can't think of any random quotes... ah! Wahh! Now, I am off to work on the website. Mangos... and cheese! (omg- wait! Kim, I am doing the "Origin of T-K-OH, with squirrels!" I need a better script idea...) Here's my quote then...  Tk: Once I finish the puzzle, You will all obey my fists of Iron... and cheese!!!  Tk: (again- firedrill day) Leggo my fuego!&#13;

And Pippin dies! j/k He almost does. Everyone thought he was but he didn't. SO everyone lived happily ever after. &gt; &#13;

       The Vocal Thing: You know how Mrs. Eldreth gave us points on the board for singing loud and stuff or were you not there those two days?  Yugi: yeah, me and Dest went on a rampage, but you have to admit the psychopaths are really cute ^ ^  Quiz: I was bored and taking random tests and I took the RB test again, and I was David...  Rave: Raves are Nice... ~ ^  Thursday Lunch: We were all really bored and were pretending to be the power rangers. Then Mouse complained that she's always a cat thing in stuff and was going to make a Mouse Zoid. So there's your explaination. Guess What?! I forgot to enter this today, it's my Dad's B-Day so bow down to him...at least say happy birthday ^ ^ HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAD!&#13;

MWA HA HA HA HA HA!!! "you have a lava lamp, i have a bucket." "most people would be happy meeting themselves once, i get to meet myself twice!" "Welcome to the TK army, and remember, it's not the size of your heart, it's the size of my paycheck. NOW GIVE ME A DOLLAR!" hehehe, you'll have to ask kim for explanation...

      Just some random shit:   There's no "I" in team but there's a "me" if you look hard enough.   A rock band called the Thompson Twins, who were an unrelated trio and no one was a Thompson.   Name one word not in the Thesaurus. ...Thesaurus.   If at first you don't succeed, remove all evidence you ever tried.&#13;

      I ment on Blogger.... any way...  This is a very very very Funny story about me and Tais adventure to get money from Gnome so she can get to the prom. First the back story. We set it up last night, that after school I would drive up to the UofD to get the money, we planned on being there around 4.... that didn turn out so well. I wanted Tai to be with me... In case soemthing went wrong.... and Boi, Heh Heh, Did they!  Now I don't Feel like telling this story again as I am tired of wrong, So I'll post me and Gnoems IM's from when I told her....Feel free to correct spelling, and shit.   So I Called this a Reality Bound Ep.

QuyteDragonSlaya:  well, we though jus by chance it maybe jus you could pay for a thing, no... so we backed out.... and were about to go back on the street when we notice     QuyteDragonSlaya:  that lil parking loops around, and comes out to our right, with no gaurder things blockin it, and jus "wrong way, and one way street" signs on it...and there was parkin at teh end of it...     RavNic1:  oh no you didn't   QuyteDragonSlaya:  So  turn to Tai and I'm like "wana be daring"  "Sure"  "hang on"  and speed down the one way parking thing hahahaha     QuyteDragonSlaya:  in the wrong direction hahaha     QuyteDragonSlaya:  and people all out and watchin us, givin us looks hahaha     QuyteDragonSlaya:  and we park, and on the slant you are not supoused to be able to park, amazeingly, i did it perfectly     QuyteDragonSlaya:  so we jump out, and are tryin to act all casual.... haha     QuyteDragonSlaya:  and of course we relize, that to park there... you need a lil pass in your window as well... which we did not.... So i am like... Ok lets make this fast befor anyone has time to get a cop or soemthiin out here....     QuyteDragonSlaya:  So we like speed walked up to trabant, and jay walked a lot to get there, not careing if we pissed people off     RavNic1:  good boy   QuyteDragonSlaya:  sorry, sis was talkin to me     QuyteDragonSlaya:  so we walk around in trabant, our front of trabant, prolly acorss the street from where u are....

(Yahuk Yahuk ^_^***) Janine wants me to tell you all about Daniel and how he spit all over himself. Blah!!   Caption Contest  (Why didn't I win the last time?? Anyway, here it is:) So...

      *wishes she'd stop being sick* :p If anyone wants to blame someone for me not being there today, blame TK. I had this dream last night...well actually i had two but anyway, the first one, I thought it was today, and we were going through the normal school day, i was late so i didn't get to see TK and his scythe it'll 4th period. at lunch, we all went up to my locker, per normal except TK was really going at it with his cloak and scythe. And then he opened his locker grabbed pete, who was for some reason in there and why did i make him sound like a person?. and stabbed him with the scythe. Friut guts went everywhere and it smelled horrible! I mean, it was so nasty! Dest, Assia and I ran to the bathroom next to the dance room and D and Tai ran the other way. I woke up in my bathroom throwing up. *shivers* it was sooooo nasty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (pete i mean but that was too)  Ugh! the second dream i had when i got back to sleep about 7 o'clock. For some reason, we (my family) took a train to a mall where there were all these fansy resuranunts. We going to have dinner with my aunt and grandparents there. We met David and TK in front of the resuraunt, they were just there chillin' . But the i remebered i didn't have time to change from my p.j.s (i'm standing there in a mall in my pjs!)  so my dad and i went into stores trying to find a fansy outfit for me. We went into this one store and he picked up these cool sparkley pair of pants and then he said they would fit cause I was fat. HE CALLED ME FAT! and then I woke up. &gt; *Sounds like Cho making fun of her mother* Moral of story...don't drink a bottle of v. coke when yo feel sick at 1 am in the morning then go to bed. Also, if your friend tells you they love you...DON'T PUNCH! say...thank you.&#13;

      ATTENTION DUELISTS! no i'm not going to say the quote, i just needed some sort of heading. anyway, as some of you know i went to my sister's play at her school a while ago and there are some weird things that you must know! first off, THEIR SODA MACHINES ARE OFF EVEN AFTER SCHOOL HOURS! that was some good cherry coke.. i did have to bribe hitty-smacky with a soda so she'd stop dancing and stripping on the table in front of the rest off the cast after the play. but her soda got stuck so it al worked out, HA! and yet another reason why our school is better than thiers, they don't have an autoturrium, they just set up chairs in the cafeterria. AND THEIR CAFETERRIA IS SMALLER THAN THE SENIOR LUNCH ROOM! yeah... so anyway, their smoke machine set off the fire alarm, every night so far, lol, and my sister has a reputation as a whore at her school (we won't discuss that) so thats it. oh yeah, she did try to convince me that this guy she knew is another stalker to add to my list (if you don't know the story about the first, welll... ask someone else, i am done tellin it) wjere was i, oh yes, just because he was askin my sister if i was gonna be there for the show that night than hangin around me till i left does not mean he's my stalker! don't they have to be hiding in the bushes with a camera or somethin? anyway, my sugar high is wearing off so i'm gonna go! see you all on monday, with my sythe MWA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!  ps okay, i have to say it: attention duelists, i'm not wearing any pants! and dest, have you ever been to the dentist? hehehe, i'm gonna have to put up with mr thirsty a lot on monday now, but it was worth it&#13;

      Kim, you have done something horrible to me. I am having dreams with EWAN MCGREGOR!!!!!! AGGAGAGAGAGAAAAAA!!  Anyway, so I was riding on a bus with you and him sittin' there dressed up like Obi Wan. And I'm like, "gee, mister, you look familiar. What's your name?" And he's like, "Ewan Mcgregor." And I was like, "Wow. You're famous!" So then we get off the bus and he's running around training jedi and kim's having mucho fun at this point and I'm so bored. Then one of the jedi throw on a magic necklace that allows them to do like harry potter crap and I'm like... what happened to the force? "that's outdated" anyway... it was weird.  I'm advanced! go to: oekaki.n3.net and go to the advanced board! I have a pic of link up there!! :)&#13;

I'm not here at the moment for I am busy saving some poor pathetic race from destruction, being smelly and manly, or hanging with one of my many girlfriends. *slap* ow! *beeeeeeeep*  Arwen: Hello, this is Arwen, daughter of Peter Jennings... I mean Elrond. If You wish to talk to me, leave a message after the beep. But- If it's Aragorn, don't bother. I'm not talking to you.  Tom Bombadill: This is Tom! Are your ponies smarter than you? Are you lost in the Barrow Downs? Are you looking for a good time? Then stop on by, me and Goldberry have Karaoke every thurday and tuesday oh!

       Chicago's Best Burger?   So tonight for Easter dinner,  urlLink John  and I (and others) were at a restaurant debating the menu.  "CHICAGO'S BEST BURGER" the menu proclaimed. Well, well, well. We had nothing of that. Best burger? If this is true, tell me:  - How can you put a price tag on the ONE hamburger that is the best in Chicago? If the one I am eating is the best, does that mean the one the guy next to me is eating is not quite as good? Or is it better? I want to know! The name is misleading. It should be the "best hamburger s  in Chicago." Fix it.  - The only way a burger can be deemed "the best" is if it has been eaten. If it's not eaten, then what was it, the best-looking burger? best smelling? And don't tell me they could eat half of the burger and tell. What if the second half is grossly undercooked, or has a large squirming tapeworm in it? Human finger? Didn't anyone else see that episode of Buffy? Therefore you cannot base the quality of an individual burger. The name should now be " Chicago's best burger recipe(or preparation). "  - I live in Minneapolis. How am I eating Chicago's best burger if I'm not in Chicago? This is not Chicago's best burger. It may be the best burger FROM Chicago; and since it's not the burger that is the best, but the recipe, it is in actuality the " Best burger recipe(or preparation) FROM Chicago. "  - But wait! Who is to say it's the best? It is not mathematical, it was voted. Not only was it voted, but it was voted by an uneven representation of demographics! Therefore it is in actuality " Voted the best burger recipe (or preparation) FROM Chicago, as decided subjectively by a panel of individuals, having no basis in fact. Choose for yourself. "  I am all about Political Correctness, and THIS my friends is not PC.&#13;&#13;

It was hella funny.  SPEAKING of funny things. Does anyone remember that episode of the Simpsons where Homer has that lobster that he raises and he becomes buddies with it and he loves it, but then he ends up eating it? The whole time he's bawling his eyes out saying "oh you taste so good," loving how it tastes... but still crying? That was pretty funny. Ironic too. I love random Simpsons quotes that mean nothing. :)&#13;&#13;

      SOMETHING I AM WONDERING ABOUT:  On the bus today there was this couple. Kinda ugly, both of them, nothing to write home about, but they were being very affectionate and I thought it was kinda adorable, but then I realized a few things:  1: It was one-sided. He had his hand on her neck and back, rubbing her, squeezing her and such. Every once in a while she giggled, but I have seen the behavior before, it's something of a "you're mine" pet. The kind you do when you run your fingers through your retriever's hair. It disturbed me.  2: He didn't look at her. Granted, he might suffer neck strain if he did, but the entire time he looked around the bus. I was listening to music and trying to ignore the scene, but I caught him staring right at me out of the corner of my eye a few times. Now what is that? Is that the "See this? She's mine!" stare? Like 1, I have seen this before too. You look around to make sure nobody's looking at your girl. If you see someone looking at your girl, you check to make sure there is no eye contact. She was not looking at anyone, I could tell. She made it a point to look above and between people.  I'm probably paranoid, but the look in his eyes and the behavior I saw I've seen before and I didn't like it one bit. Was I wrong to want to punch him just for my assumptions? o_O&#13;&#13;

      My complaint for tonight lies solely on the shoulders of the menace that is AVANT GARDE CINEMA!  *crowd boo's and hisses*  First movie we watched tonight was some hillbilly's home movies, including a woman giving birth. They showed it, close up, beginning to end... all the blood and placenta and umbelical cords and everything. And... wow. Yeah. That didn't exactly turn me on.  Now... something else we saw was about a gay man's infatuation with sailors, and the one sailor who stayed behind after the other sailors beat the gay guy up. Then the gay sailor picked up the gay man (who was now naked) and carried him home, and they slept together, and it was so romantic.  The guy who did the second movie's name is Kenneth Anger, and I read a review about him that labeled his films as personal masturbatory material. It makes sense. "Scorpio Rising" is just people straight from the Blue Oyster Bar. Scary. Someone hold me?  Please?&#13;&#13;

           Concerned Observer:  As Christians know, aureoles (or halos) are fluffy ring-shaped clouds that hover above  the heads of Jesus, Mary, and all the saints. In every day life, the spiritual observer sees halos above the heads of righteous people, and sees devil horns  above the heads of sinners. The secular observer sees no difference.   The Devil cannot stand goodness! To mock the Lord, he has created  counterfeit halos in nuclear explosions, and rubber prophylactics. They are equally destructive.   Atomic warfare has gone out of fashion, so Satan has no choice but to promote condoms.  If they looked satanic, people wouldn't sin and use them. But fornication seems  almost righteous when any Tom, Dick, or Harry can claim that  little halo, if only for a moment.   The Bible clearly states that no Christian would use one!   Praise the Word!

      Dude. I have really not been in the mood for school work, yet school starts back up Monday and I have midterms week. What the hell is that, do you expect people to read and study and do papers over spring break? Granted, I had no reason not to since I didn't go anywhere, but the point is... the fact that I didn't go anywhere made me feel all the more reluctant to do any work, so I haven't and don't want to. Screw them.  I'm going to bed.&#13;&#13;

      My thoughts of the day:  Maury Povich: Now, it's no secret that Maury likes having little girls on his show whom he can hug and kiss and fondle to his wee heart's content. That's all fine and good, he also has freaks of nature on whom he does the same thing to. a 3' midget burn victim... *shudders* I guess you gotta take the crookeds with the straights if you want to fondle little girls. Anyway.  Yesterday as I wasted another Spring Break day I turned it to Maury, and he had the special "voyeur" show, where different people were videotaped doing "naughty" things. All well and good, right? Yeah, you know where I'm going with this, right? There was a girl of 14 who was videotaped at a mall, changing for a photoshoot... she had been caught naked, and in various states of undress.  How horrible!  Well Maury, the loving host had the girl (like 9 years later) on the show, and on the screen was -- you guessed it -- the video tape of the 14 year old girl in various states of undress! They blurred the topless scenes... but... what the hell is that? o_O  All right, I have more to bitch about, including Ricki Lake and Shipmates, but my white trash TV rant is finished for tonight!&#13;&#13;

I just have a question, for the female types... what the hell is up with those long long sweaters? They look like dresses, so when you wear pants with them, it just looks... freaky. Ghetto for sure. I'm thinking 80's when I see thick pants under a skirt, because I'm thinking leggings.   I seriously have to throw whatever those sweater things into my burning oil drum along with capri pants and peacoats. Death to all three of them!&#13;&#13;

       urlLink Libby  asked the question "How do you just... stop... doing something that has become a habit?" and that reminds me of something I've been wondering for quite a while...  I've always prided myself on self-diagnosis; on being able to fix whatever it is that is wrong with me, but that just isn't so recently. As I grow older, I grow more wary. It is to the point where I cannot even believe myself. So how the hell do I trick myself? I can't outsmart myself to unlearn a behavior, or learn a new one. I'm wise to my own tricks, and thus am stuck how I am with no chance of conscious change.  There is such a fine line between being normal and being too smart for your own good. Balancing on that line is the ability to do anything you want, mentally... the ability to teach the old dog new tricks. But for me, that ability is gone. Perhaps this dog is too old to learn new tricks, and where I was when I stumbled across that line is where I'm left to sit for the rest of my life.  Holy crap, I'm beginning to see how it's so easy to get melodramatic on a blogger. You don't mean to, but it just starts coming out as "woe is me," and again, here I am sounding like a head case. woo?&#13;&#13;

      All right. I could probably expand this to 10,000 words or more, but as it stands, I wrote a &gt;2,000 word essay on Love, FOR FUN, in an hour and a half tonight. Yes, I was that bored. However, due to the sppppppppppeeeeeeeeeeeeeed in which I cranked it out, it is very disjointed and is probably very questionable at spots. Well, I would proofread it later if, you know, I wanted to read a fucking 2,000 word essay about Love, so I'm going to leave it alone.

      Hello.  So now I'm starting to get slightly anxious about my impending birthday:   If anyone wants to send me a present (Card, money, pornography[bought or personal]) please mail it soon to:  AlphaBean Enterprises c/o AlphaBean 4451 Pleasant Av. S. Minneapolis, MN 55409  Not that I have some huge internet following... but gee I love getting things in the mail!  Also... I don't live there, I just get my mail there... so don't come visit me... I swear! O_o  So beware the Ides of March... FOR THERE WILL BE A DRUNKEN WILDEBEAST ON THE LOOSE ON THE STREETS!&#13;&#13;

      Nobody posts comments on my blogger.   Should I go drama queen? All right, I'll go drama queen.  Why do I even bother? It's of no use anymore... I just can't finish an entire package of processed American cheese. I don't know how Homer Simpson did it, but he is a God. I am just a man. No, I'm less than a man... I am a... err, almost-man. That's all I am.  I wrote a poem about it, too, entitled "Paradise Lost." I would post it but it's kinda long. Hope you guys can forgive a brotha...  Oh and Rainbow Brite sucks for taking advantage of my gullibility! :(&#13;&#13;

      I'll tell you what is fun: Looking at a stripper so she comes towards you, thinking you will give her money, then you look away and ignore her. She is hurt, dejected; not because of the feigned attention, but because she was not paid.  Why is that fun? Because all a strip club is is girls who pretend like you're something special with the sole intent of taking your money. You give them the money, they perform prostitutesque moves on you when nobody is looking, get up, take your cash, and leave you wanting more. This is what causes men to pay even more money for the crack-addicted trashy cousin of the stripper: the prostitute. Not only does the prostitute want your money, she also wants to give YOU a nice little gift in return in the form of an STD.  "But that's not fair!" She exclaims as she hits you over the head with the motel bible. She calls her pimp to come up and cut out your kidney, and they steal your wallet, leaving you in a bath tub full of ice cubes which have numbed your genitals so you can't yet sense the package the whore left you.  And I'm talkin DOWNTOWN!  And that, friends, is why you should never let your friends borrow your solid-fill love doll.&#13;&#13;

      And here it is, my page is updated again and hopefully it's a little calmer than before. Granted, it's nowhere near as wonderful because it's missing so much of the original charming pandaness etc., but it's a work in progress, and if you have a problem I have the old pages up I believe www.alphabean.net/scottw.html www.alphabean.net/scottw2.html www.alphabean.net/scottw3.html www.alphabean.net/scottw4.html and so on.  All right now it has come to my attention that Ellen is not dead. For those of you who don't know,   Is Ellen, the toothless bitch whom everybody and their mother should hate. Anybody who wants to make a nice anti-Ellen graphic using this picture... or the other picture of her floating around, feel free.   And remember kids: You're not safe until Ellen is destroyed!  The comments are broken too, I'll need to figure that shit out. :(&#13;&#13;

Here I got until Tuesday morning to finish my paper and I went to the library and got a book and all, I have the thesis... but christ, I just want to sleep until the semester is over.  F' this weather!!!! I want warm happy weather again. I can't concentrate.  I can't even remember what I was going to say right here...

       New Heat Update!   I was told earlier this evening that the heat was probably well over 100 degrees in here, possibly upwards of 200 degrees. I doubt it was 200, since you know, I'd be dead and all, but it was maybe around 150. The thermostat hit 300 but the furnace couldn't quite hit that I don't think. Either way... wow, I'm alive.  Now shut up.  I need a drink!&#13;&#13;

       Immense Heat Update:   Last night, well, this morning when I lay down to sleep, my bed was hot. Unseasonably warm, and it felt like it was plugged in. Everything in this house is hot to the touch. What the shit is this?  I woke up way, way too early this morning, because it's too hot to sleep, and it's so COLD outside, and nothing can be done about it. Wah.   urlLink John  left and slept elsewhere, while I was stuck in this icky icky hot place, with only a fan... a fan in front of the radiator... blowing hot air... what the damn?  So now I embark on a journey of actually doing school work, if I can. We shall see. Highly doubt it, but I shall try!  I just remembered a dream I had last night... it was a mix of Black Knight (the Martin Lawrence "movie"), Scorpion King (mainly, just the commercial, where he's using the bow and arrow), and my own sick and twisted mind creating a magical world where a magical arrow can bring you back to life... or something gay like that. o_O  That is why unnatural heat is a bitch: It makes Bean crazy.&#13;&#13;

If anybody knows somebody who actually could use one of these words, let them know so maybe they can come get them from the trash can; but don't mind the banana peels.  So right now, the temperature outside is maybe 40 degrees if that, and the temperature inside is probably 96. The thermostat is fucked, so I'm either going to freeze or melt. WOOOOOOOOnderful.

Peety girls in Summer clothes  Can walk on the sidewalk without fearing that moment when you realize you are parallel to the ground and are on your way to a sore ass. (don't say it, bastards.)  And sports. I don't have as many excuses to sit on my ass 24 hours a day online.  When I mentioned Summer clothes, I started hearing "Paint it Black" in my mind. And now I'm creeped out. That song is twisted as hell.  I guess that's why it's the theme song for Twisted Metal Black? [/ramble]  Oh yeah, and yesterday was my first day back to school after a 5-day weekend.

      So I didn't go to class yesterday due to a migraine. I couldn't think straight and was in a shitload of pain when I went to bed so I emailed my teachers and put them in the outbox to be sent in the morning. When I got up to send them, I checked and saw they were already sent and replied to!  Well, the one wasn't replied to until later when the teacher told me he hopes my hangover gets better. I laughed at that, then thought to myself... DAMN IT! I wasn't drinking, and even if I was, I don't get hangovers, so that's just wrong. Perhaps I should reply to his e-mail and set him straight. o_O  Yes, yes you're right. It's been three days since I've posted and I needed something to mention and I couldn't think of anything.  Well, me and  urlLink John  played basketball today cause it's nice out. That was my day.  How was yours? :|&#13;&#13;

      So instead of doing homework all day, I've been playing Madden, going out to lunch with my brothers and then a thought came to me while I was in the library, doing a crossword puzzle: What kind of crossworder are you? Do you like to wait until you've got them all figured out before filling them in, or do you like to write over, or erase anything you have wrong? Me, I go as far as I can without editing and if I get one wrong and I get stuck, I quit. I rule like that.   Anyway, all night I've been trying to find a crossword puzzle maker, and FINALLY I found one and it rules bigtime. So, I've made a crossword puzzle about things found on my site.

      In the last half hour of the day I thought I would give you all a thrilling recap of my Friday, April 5th, nineteen ninety twelve.  Around midnight, I passed out from being sick and exhausted from a harrrd week of, well, classes. Okay so it wasn't hard, but it still tired me out cause I'm sick.  I get up at quarter to eight and hop on here for a while, then go downstairs for some banana bread and to finish my game of Madden.  Then, it's off to my brother's for a long day of driving in his peacup, and napping while he ran in places. Then I bought a DVD; then we made more stops (one to the liquor store) and eventually came home. Left around noon and came back around six.   So, he bought his DirecTV and it got set up. Played some Virtua Fighter 2 with him (and drank) and Pokemon Stadium 2 with his daughter, and then we watched about 600 channels of tv (whilst drinking). After the kids went to bed, Skinemax came on and we watched some Emmanuelle something or other, a softcore porn about a hot blonde with mind control devices and pierced nipples. I give it four stars.  Then I came home. And now I want to pass out again. I'm tired.  First, I gotta go pick on a certain drunk girl some more... ;) &#13;&#13;

      What's my problem?  I sit on my ass for half a semester and then midterms come around, I'm stressed out (for reasons other than midterms) in fact, I can't even study for midterms... but I take them, expect to get a C or worse, and end up getting 102%. That's kool.   Another Tale From the Bus   I love Minnesota Metro Transit. The bus drivers must all be subjected to psychological tests, because after driving around in the worst traffic ever, in the bitter cold, they're still good people.  I often hear about places not having any busing at all, much less a high-quality system like here.  My question to you:  What's the public transportation like there? o_O&#13;&#13;

       EDIT: I used the wrong link (thanks again to Dereque)  For anyone who hasn't seen it I think I have to direct your attention here:   urlLink Cute/Funny Stick Figure Pictures  (courtesy of Dereque)  They are cute and funny. Now, onto today's business.   Fashion Complaint of the Day:   Who the motherfuck wears a pastel sweater tied around their neck/shoulders? WHY do all the talk shows include them in makeovers (along with capri pants, sleeveless sweaters and sunglasses in your hair, not on your nose). Does anybody find this look hip or attractive in the least? I think it's horrible, but maybe I'm missing something. Kixx, what's your opinion? You like long sweaters and Andre the Giant shirts, do you like sweaters over your shoulders? Because honestly, outside of TV I've never seen a girl doing that.       Andre the Giant in his shirt.&#13;&#13;

       I just realized something.   I'm all alone.  I looked out my window tonight on the way home and saw a sorority house: "Technical Women Students."  Why don't I get that? Every minority gets their own group, their own club, somewhere to fit in. The only group for fat people and heavy drinkers end in "Anonymous," and the sole purpose is to STRIP YOU of those traits. Society just wants me to be a normal, boring, young adult middle class white male with no known distinguishing characteristics.  I'm not a frat boy. I'm not stupid and slutty or average looking enough. Plus, I hate beer, and I suck at frisbee. My parents aren't rich, and I don't like the concept of pledging. I don't embarass myself for acceptance. I just sit on my ass and ask for it while doing nothing.  I'm an English major. What do I do? I could be in an artsy book club, but I don't read. I'm not a pseudo-intellectual I'm an actual fucking intellectual. I'm smart but only as smart as I am. I do not act any smarter. I do not use lots of big words and I don't quote people. I do not fit in with my own group. I have no group. As "up myself" as I am, I'm nowhere near where I should be and that is sad.  I need some horn rimmed glasses and a black turtle neck and start writing poetry because this whole "being unique" bullshit is not all it's cracked up to be.&#13;&#13;

       urlLink John's Website.   I just want to STRONGLY URGE my viewers at home to look at his website today. It really is a beautiful thing.  *edit* April Fool's is over so that's the link to what USED to be John's website. I renamed it, and his website is back to normal. *sigh* he didn't find it funny, not one bit!!!!&#13;&#13;

       Slackers   Wow. This movie rocked. John will agree with me when I say...this movie rocked.  In a sea of unoriginal comedy, this little fishy had many complex characters, and by complex I mean really fucked up and unpredictable and Laura Prepon rules. Usually I like it when the straight man is as zany as the comic relief, and this was no different... Devon Sawa... eh. Allow me to be shallow here: He needs braces. In a world that ridicules Jewel to no end about her teeth, Devon Sawa needs some fucking braces.  Anyway, Slackers almost made me hate it with the evilness of Jason Schwartzmann, but still... certain parts of the film were funny. I won't ruin the jokes, because joke ruiners are stupid.  But I will ruin this commercial I've seen, don't know if any of yall have seen it:  These two kids are standing in a field on a farm, they are saying something about the Burger King Big Kids meal, when they ponder "how will we get there?" at which point they turn to the family horse and they have an epiphany.  The next scene shows the two kids sitting in the cab of a pickup truck, with the horse behind the wheel, driving. I don't know if this commercial is intentionally hilarious, but I cracked up watching it, and John laughed just hearing aboot it. Funny.  Also: In my recent brainwashing at the hands of MTV 2 I have fallen in love with Norah Jones. Is that wrong? I know that MTV 2 are just MTV in disguise... but I can't help it. I'm a sucker for a pretty voice. And so impressionable...&#13;&#13;

      131 hits until 3k!  God, I'm pathetic. First of all, I'm pretty sure the site has had more than that, but since a lot of the webrings force me to include my blogger url instead of alphabean.net, the counter isn't picking up every hit. Anyway, are you tired of this midi? I know I am... so pick out what song you want to be soured on by listening to it in annoying midi form for 500 more hits on my counter ;)  So I keep ripping people off out of boredom, and I'm wondering what else I need. Expert bloggers of the world, feel free to give me advice. Just don't ask me to make it less annoying... I just can't do that.  Also, if you haven't figured it out, the off-the-wall responses on here are from my brother. I think he wants to post on my blog because he's a bigger attention whore than I am. Pay attention to him, people.  Eventually he'll get his own blog set up and then I'll have that link up and you can all pay attention to him like you do for me!   Nah....  I blogged a lot last night because I wasn't tired. The heat makes me not tired, and I'm again awake and don't wanna be. Three hours of sleep today afternoon... then basketball and lawnmowing. Still not tired. Aaaaaargh. 91 degrees here today. Um. Now it's senseless sleepy rambling, my cue to sign off.  OVER AND OUT.  I am the daddy. o_O&#13;&#13;

      BATS!@!@#@%@$^%&amp;*U%^%$$#@  All right so my house is special, yall. You know how lots of houses have little doggie doors? Well not so much because of skinny burglars, but in the movies all houses have doggie doors. Anyway, my house has a special bat door. Every summer is bat season; every winter, mouse season. Like clockwork, there's another bat in my basement. There will be about five in all this year, as in every other year. They are pretty good about staying in the basement, but sometimes they don't.  DATELINE CIRCA 1985 CE, my brothers and I are playing on the hide-a-bed in the den (I think), when a great big black thing comes up from the basement. I, being the brave little five-year-old I am, dive under the hide-a-bed and, well, hide. This was my earliest bat memory.  DATELINE LIKE A FEW YEARS AGO, I was washing my face down in the basement, as there is no working sink above the basement, when I see something moving in the washer to my left. My glasses were off so it was just black and furry and moving, so I slammed the cover, assuming it was a bat or something bat-like. Lo and behold, one cold-rinse cycle later, the shivering, unconscious bat was removed from the washer and released into the wild, alive. Good stuff.  DATELINE I FORGOT, MAYBE TWO YEARS BEFORE THE LAST ONE, I was sitting on my computer chit chatting with people when a bat came up. Me, being the brave upper-teen teenager I was, hit the deck and came upstairs, signing online up here. I am sure some of the people I knew back then may recall this. It was quite funny, oh it was indeed.   Later on, as I gathered the courage, I hunted this damned bat. It was no floozie bat, it did not go home the next morning. I grabbed my AWESOME blow gun and shot its wing with a blow dart. Eventually it flew away so I can't prove that I have good aim, but I thought I got him (sorry Kelly). I am pretty sure he/she/it was ok though. However, I got a blow dart stuck in my ceiling. Kinda sucked. Got it out though, but I believe Josh and/or Sam broke the mouthpiece of the gun as it was on my floor, since I am a messy bastard. Anywho, I can't shoot anymore bats, b'gorrah, and I was fin ta, too, to have lunch for tomorrow....  TTFN.&#13;&#13;

      Vanilla Sky  So I saw this movie tonight. I didn't really want to see it, as I have honed the ability to tell a shitty movie from its commercials, and this movie had some of the worst. It's a damned shame that the advertising was so horrible, because I really really liked it.  Now, I'm still as skeptical as ever, and fully realized this was just another head trip of a movie witholding vital information in an attempt to throw you off making you think you've been fooled, but the ways Vanilla Sky worked were very new and, erm, for lack of a better term, kicked ass.  One reviewer for the film had said there were too many twists and turns, so many that they lost their effectiveness. Listening to him I thought "Wow! That really sucks!" After seeing it, however, I cannot believe how thoroughly he missed the point. For those keeping score, he was some Minneapolis News reviewer, I think. Anyway, one thing I noticed about Vanilla Sky was that every time something happened that I wanted to talk about, I had no chance to say so. The plot just moved too quickly. I couldn't avert my eyes for a second without missing something -- and not everything missed was all that important, either. That doesn't matter; what matters is that I was on my heels for most of the movie and wasn't given time to fully think about what was happening.  To my credit, though, I almost figured it out. As I said, certain things were omitted to make you feel like you weren't smart enough to get it. To avoid spoiling the movie, I will avoid spoiling the movie, but anyway...  Part two of this funky rhyme, G(Something of a spoiler, indeed):  I caught the eeriest feeling when Aames finally found Sophia, up until he woke up the next morning. What feeling? Well, the feeling that I could relate to his life as it existed at that moment. The way she treated him, his reaction... it was soopa powerful for me because I know what that feels like.  All right, now, to lighten the mood (for me, not for you, asshead), here's a dancing skeleton:   &#13;&#13;

      Two un-touched-upon points:  1: A cowboy movie with Kelso from That 70's Show, Usher and Dawson from Dawson's Creek? OH MY GOD that's going to kill Spiderman at the box office! o_O Seriously though... just... what the hell? My brain just exploded all over the friggin place. That's the worst trio of stars any movie could ever fathom! Argh! And not even Rachael Leigh Cook can save it, unless she gets all nekkid... and shows up in my room... but you know the chances of that happening are like, 2:1.  2: So now MTV is going to be sued for some fucking IDIOT teenager who set himself on fire in his back yard as his parents were busy ignoring him, and making sure he couldn't read the disclaimer about not doing stuff they do on "Jackass" at home. I personally saw the episode where they set themselves on fire, and the instructor was pretty explicit that you can easily die if you do it... so could this boy not comprehend English? Was he watching and saying "fiiiiiiiire coooooooool?" If you're stupid enough to ignore the warnings, and you know, have a COMPLETE wont of common sense, you have larger problems than media influence, you've gotta see a shrink, and a tutor, and possibly Kevorkian, because if you're over five years old and you can't figure out that it's bad to set yourself on fire, there is little to no hope for you.   Just let those kinds of people out on their own; a speeding bus will eventually end their suffering when they wander into traffic.&#13;&#13;

BIBBY SCORES! 8 seconds left. *suspense*  Red and this girl were engaged in adult relations... he was up in it, and he said to her "I'm gonna cum!"  What was her reaction?    "Where you goin?" "I'm gonna CUM!!!" "Where ya goin?" "I am going to have an orgasm!" he said finally.  That's it for the story. I love drunken bar stories.  KINGS WIN! KINGS WIN! OH YEAHHHHH&#13;&#13;

       The Origins of AlphaBean: Part 1  (It's in reverse order, remember?)  Q: "Why do you prefer Bean over Scott?"  A: It's a many-faceted explanation, which is undoubtedly too complex for your simple minds. Just kidding. First of all, I like it as a nickname. It suits me, it's silly... and it's not "Scottie." I hate hate hate being called "Scottie" and you may ask 'well then why did you go by Scottie when you first came around?' and I will answer you that it was the only thing I could come up with that in the tiniest bit described who I was. I have found the moniker to do so in AlphaBean.  Also, in the past year, I have grown ashamed of the name Scott. It has come to signify things I can't comprehend and that disgust me. If I do not see myself as Scott, I cannot fall into that same hole. At least I fucking hope that's true ;)  I have another reason, one more personal... but I'm not going to be a Drama Bean here and type it out. All you need to know is that I prefer to be called Bean than Scott. At least online. For some reason, having anyone call me one thing after calling me another for as long as they've known me, just doesn't sit well. I'm not a big fan of change.  That is all.&#13;&#13;

       What's an AlphaBean?   Okay so Dana (link to the right) questioned a couple of things tonight: 1) Why do I prefer being called Bean over Scott, and 2) What the fuck is an AlphaBean?  Well let's go in reverse order:  32 years ago on the streets of Manila, there lived a little pauper boy named Scott. That was me. Except it wasn't Manila, it was Minnesota. And it wasn't the street... it was my couch. And it wasn't 32 years ago... it was, like, three. Oh, and I was never a pauper. I am a PRINCE. You hear me? PRINCE!!!!  Anyway, I had just bought a laptop (which has long since been destroyed), and also bought the game Worms 2. I was the daddy at that game, and my squad, whose names I've forgotten, were led by one Alpha Bean. Basically, he was the leader, and his name was Bean. He fucking ruled. He was usually the only worm I had left on the more tricky, difficult levels. ANYWAY.  I had been known on the internet as Scottie, ScottieW, ScoTTieX, and then Spifferz. Spifferz was so gay, but I was told it was close enough to ScoTTieX that it was ok. Well I made a drastic change and adopted the name of my favorite worm, AlphaBean. Now, I am world-famous and so is my name. In fact, even javascript fuckers have stolen my name to use on their code. That is irrelevant. Basically, I'm now me, and you all have been graced by my glorious humility and character.  I'm so special that I think I'll wait until tomorrow for part 1, so that this doesn't end up being too long of a post.&#13;&#13;

      Knee Brace!  I've found what I've been missing all these years. I have been in dire need of a knee brace. Later on I think I'll post the story about my broken leg and the ensuing problems, but right now I'll just say that when I was 11 my femur was broken, and ever since I've had a pretty weak quad and the way I walked from it resulted in a permanent, I don't know what it's called, but my feet are bent inward and my kneecaps go outward and it's a bitch, and is resulting in arthritic symptoms.  Anyway, I got the brace, and I can actually run, and bend my knee, and it doesn't hurt, and my leg goes straight up. It's funny that for some reason I hadn't gotten one before... you know, in 11 years. o_O  So this isn't an entertaining post or funny or anything... I'm sorry. I think all my funny evaporated with the alcohol from last night. I still haven't told yall about that yet, and I won't... yet. Not tonight.  Also, Samantha's site is almost done. I just have to get bored enough to open Dreamweaver up on my P2 333 with 64 megs ram again. :P  OH MY GOD I have chronic boringness today.

       The Heather Bar   OK so I'll try not sounding too shallow tonight. I just came back from the bar... a Heather bar. For the uninformed, Heather = blonde, usually falsely tanned, "like, omigod" young woman, of which there are thirty BILLION in Minnesota.  They're generally pretty cute, though with makeup and tanning, you can never be sure if you're really just attracted to a robot in disguise. Or, you know... an exact replica of yourself.  SO. I've heard quite a few great stories tonight. I'm way too drunk to tell them right now, so I will wait until tomorrow or such.  I'm really ashamed that I don't go drinking more.  Anyway... On a scale of 1-10 I just told a friend I was about 7.5 which is pretty damned drunk, so I'm going to go pass out, since my work here... is done. What work, you ask?  DIE.  I won't tell you until I'm sober.  BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  *thud*&#13;&#13;

I believe I am supposed to take the opportunity to make a shout out to blogsnob... not like they need to be advertised, but... o_O  Oh, and I'm not gay if you were wondering. :)  I've posted two measly excerpts from conversations on the Convos section, still waiting for people to start putting stuff up. I've invited BurnZy so hopefully he will get it going sufficiently.  Future projects for me include making a section for Sammi Jo, who is Josh's big sister, so you can see some pictures of her on Josh's page. I'm also going to work on my family tree, and I'll be uploading it -- I dunno if I'm going to make it public though. I suppose it's for the best so I know if I'm related to any of you before you try scoring with me. o_O   That was a joke.  I've made a short wishlist, maybe next I'll make my little music list so people know what I listen to -- not that you can't tell by my wish list... o_O  Oh, and I AM a monkey, if you were wondering. :)&#13;&#13;

      All right so I gave in.  I am so desperate for attention and for my little counter to go up, that I'm joining webrings. What this means is I want people visiting, and I want people clicking that little "comment" link under my posts. Do you hear me?  As I've said to Joanna (no link for her, but she comments from time to time), we should begin a life of crime. This whole nothing-to-blog existence is getting to me, it really is. What can I say? I don't do much. It's summer now, and work is such a bitch that I am easily spent, so I sit around playing videogames.  So hi kids, I rented NBA2k2 last week and played it. I'm not very good. I don't really play enough video games anymore, because there aren't any good multiplayer games outside of sports.  I'm thinking about adding a TV rant section to my site so I can discuss what happened on the few shows I watch: WWE Wrestling, Smallville, Dark Angel(rip) and all the trashy hookups shows like Elimidate, and Shipmates. Everyone needs a forum to discuss Elimidate!  And now, as people are checking out my site for reviews and such, they see just what a pathetic loser I am, and I will forever be labeled as such. :(  So this is a long rant, perhaps I should work on my template and shrink the font some more so it looks like I didn't type so much.  I wish I could post more funny shit on here, but I think for that I need to start drinking more religiously. I haven't been to a liquor store in a few weeks, so I have nothing to aide me to that end. So until that day...  Battle on, Xena! [thumbs up]&#13;&#13;

The big pickle is officially retired, due to the dozens and dozens of emails demanding it is too phallic, therefore sexist, therefore un-PC, and if I didn't remove it I would be sued.  That's right.

So bow down and kiss the ring of the mighty Prince of AlphaBeania.  Yeh, I'm exhausted and been drinking so I'm extra annoying today.     I've decided, that since nobody posts comments and few people visit my site, that every 500th visitor chooses the midi I play. That way, if you hate the midi currently playing, convince your homies or mates or bootie calls to check out l'alfbeanette.     Shhhh! Don't tell anyone, but www.iweek.com the magazine, which has 52 issue subscriptions for $200.00 gave me a free subscription. I really have no use for the magazine, but who am I to complain? Anyone want to get me more free stuff? Free stuff is wundafoo. I still have the link to get free silkies pantyhose, and I wanted to get someone a pair of soopa triple XL pantyhose, that would rule. It would work wundas for John's big head if he wanted to rob a bank.  ErM, I think I've rambled enough.&#13;&#13;

      Two things:  First of all, I tried to do that referrer thing for my page and it ain't working. I am too damned tired to remove it and give up now so pretend it's not there. It's not like this site is exactly the fruit of my perfectionism, now is it?  Third of all, I've forgotten my second point. I suppose you're all lucky, for now. Tomorrow I will be back with an all-new point, and this one will be DEADLY.&#13;&#13;

      You know, I really love Tara MacLean, and this here is why:  urlLink Tour Diary   Go down to her June 28th entry, if you care about people whose innocense (or "light" as she calls it) is lost, and how they handle it.   Even her journal entries are worded so nicely, I'm surprised she is not extremely famous. She will be...  o_O  I don't generally sound all gay and gush over people like that, but hey... I've been a fan for years and I like getting the word out ;)&#13;&#13;

      You know what sucks ass?  Asian chicks don't dig the big guys. That's a damn shame, because I like the Asian chicks.    You know what else sucks? Drinking so much you embarass yourself, but you don't drink enough that you can't remember embarassing yourself. God damn it, I'd prefer to wake up tied to a tree with my head shaved and my pants around my ankles and not know what the hell happened, than to wake up the next morning and be ashamed.  On the plus side... once again, no hangover. I'm such a hangoverless pimp.  On the negative side... I was mumbling incoherently in my sleep, and since I had passed out in John's chair, he got to hear it all and laugh at me.  In my defense: I brought a bottle of Cuervo Margarita to the party to share, but nobody would share, so I just kept taking cups of it until it was gone. Also, I hadn't been to sleep because of final papers. So, there I was falling asleep in the computer lab at school waiting for a ride to go to the party, then I get there and get shitfaced. O_o And when I drink, I can't sleep... so that just sucked.  And needless to say, I asked a guy at the party to drop me off somewhere along a certain street but forgot to tell him where on the street. So I was drunk, lost, but somehow made it to the bus stop. I rule! o_O  OK no I don't.  God, I keep getting flashbacks.&#13;&#13;

      New midi! How yall like it?  So today was day one of my gruelling week of hell. Next Monday will cap it off... I have until Thursday from now to rewrite my paper and my story, and then until Monday to catch up with my studies for a final.  Yeah, yeah, it's not as hellish as one would think, and yes... I've had worse. But I'm still not all-too-keen on the concept of school work. I was off 10 months before this semester, you'd think I could get some slack eh? :)  So my presentation group tonight discussed Blaxploitation. It's quite an interesting subject. I always love learning new things, and in this class I've learned quite a bit about oppositional uses of cinema, and it is expanding my cultural world and whatnot. I mean really... who knew there were movies that weren't made in America in the last 20 years? o_O&#13;&#13;

      Hey, I just converted my liquid assets to nacho's, how much you think they're worth?  Is it a deal.... or is it a tasty deal?  Dark Angel is directed by James Cameron tonight, 90 minutes of greatness co-starring Lita from the WWF. Apparently she broke her neck while filming this... which would explain why they won't say "Lita from the WWF is in this, and she broke her neck in it!"  That's about all I got.   Finals week sucks ass. Not just is it finals week (well, week before finals, but have lots of finals this week), but my niece has her first communion this weekend, so less time for work.  Now, back to the show.&#13;&#13;

      OK Some shitfuck who has visited this site has been sending me viruses, and me like a dumbass opened Outlook and it automatically opened the virus. WOooooOooOoooOOo so now that's under control...  And I made sure the preview window was no longer viewable and went to check the virus to find out who sent it, and somehow Outlook reopened the preview windows, so I got infected again.  Well, it's fixed, but Norton's being gay now. Damn the man.  Also, I gotta be up soon so I should probably go to sleep. Ta.  PS: Go reply in the music blog. :p&#13;&#13;

       Mr Deeds   FUCK THAT. Not worth a Beanie Review. It was a remake, but all they did was threw some jokes on top of it instead of actually doing anything. It seemed more like a home video of Sandler and his friends than an actual movie. I wasted a lot of money on the movie and I WANT IT BACK. :(   Lilo and Stitch   I loved this movie. It was actually funnier than 'Deeds' because it used wit and intelligence instead of "HOLY SHIT THAT'S WICKED FUCKED UP MAN" humor. It was intelligent and pretty mature, with more cohesion despite the twist-ful finish than 'Deeds."   I totally love the mischievous little alien and see myself slightly in that role, except I'm big, human, not a cartoon, and not infinitely intelligent.  Anyway, the best part of the film was when Stitch uses his powers to be constructive at the request of Lilo. I'm not spoiling anything, but look out for it, and you'll see what I mean.  I went to see the movie in Thunder Bay at some big theater with huge screens, and it was all kids (not many though), and John and I laughed our asses off when the kids didn't and it was awkward.   I want you all to watch three movies: Lilo and Stitch, The Bourne Identity, and The Shipping News. Yup.&#13;&#13;

      And now I'm back... from outer space... you just walked in to....etc...  All right well I just returned from Canada and upper Minnesota on vacation, and I had written out a list of interesting things I noticed about Canada, but I don't know where the list is right now so I will post that later. I just want to say hi, and talk about casinos.  We stopped at two casinos, one to and one from our destination. Both times I couldn't help but get depressed, as though I was in a hospital surrounded by unhappy, sick and dying people. I couldn't even handle it without alcohol, which is why I got quite depressed sober the second time around.  First of all there are the slots. This is where Social Security checks are wasted. In Canada, the elderly Americans take buses to buy their prescriptions cheaper, and on the way back they sit at the slots for HOURS and HOURS just throwing their money away. Outside of the occasional new 18 year old hanging out with friends, I haven't seen one person smile at the slots. NOT EVEN THE WINNERS! Jackpots are won, hundreds and hundreds of dollars... yet these people just stare X_X it's depressing. These people need friends worse than I do.  That leads me to my next casino area: The tables. This is where the most serious of the serious stay. Blackjack is what got people killed in the Old West, and if concealed weapons were legal today I am sure there would be many gambling-related deaths. If you take a hit when you're not supposed to or stand on a low number you gain a handful of enemies for life, because it's not just a game. The heads of the casino march in and out of the table room with armed guards watching over your every move. You can't talk or you might distract somebody. Your actions must be crisp and mathematical and you must obey strict rules. It's a game!   Holy Jesus I think I took my last trip to the casino yesterday. I don't usually care about what other people do with their lives, but I have to make an exception here. Casinos are exploitative trash and I'm not setting foot in another one again.   GRR! Anyway... hiya!&#13;&#13;

       The Shipping News   I loved this movie. I think maybe I was tricked by the quirkiness of it all... of all the characters and all the situations... Judi Dench did things I'd never expect from someone who was knighted... and many times I looked at the screen thinking... "what the fuck?"  I've been a big big huge fan of Julianne Moore as long as I can remember. She's just ungodly beautiful even at 40+ and she's a better actress than most of the trash out there (Julia Roberts). I've been a huge fan of Kevin Spacey since Outbreak, but lately I've gotten tired of him. Especially K-Pax. That was the worst movie ever. However, in Shipping News, he's solid. Granted, he was overshadowed by his supporting cast, but not buy much. The character he portrayed was complex enough that just saying he was this way or that way wouldn't suffice... so he did well.  Again... wonderful supporting cast. This movie felt very real and if it wasn't for Moore's statuesque larger-than-life beauty, I would never have thought about it being a movie.   The Shipping News was a bit slow to start, and it never really speeds up too much, but it plays like a home movie you don't want to rush, if you can put your mind in the right place. If you're looking for profundity or mindless action look elsewhere. The shame with The Shipping News is, while it's not an action movie, I am sure it would have been so much better in the theater. The 55" TV and surround sound stereo just couldn't capture it like a theater would.  You know, I went to see The Royal Tenenbaums last week and never reviewed it... I suppose I will eventually.  Also... I know I review videos and I think "The Bourne Identity" was the only new release I actually have discussed... but then I'm not all that into seeing new movies, or videos for that matter. My family rents maybe five videos a week and I only watch at most one of them. So... whatever. It's something to post when you have nothing else to post.  I do have a question, though... I have been trying to figure out a system to post stories and allow people to critique them online... does anyone have any suggestions on how to do that?&#13;&#13;

      All right so I watch a lot of TV and a lot of movies, and I see people with whom, personality-wise, I can relate. They mean well, but they put foot in mouth often, have major flaws, but in the end, while this gets them in trouble... they always end up all right, no harm done.   In the real world, I see everyone trying to be cooler than everybody else. People don't want to say what they're thinking, or say what they feel, they don't want to deal with the consequences, and they don't want to "take any risks." Tactless people with heart-on-sleeve are often looked down upon, usually because the majority of them are viewed to be substance abusers of some sort, or clinically insane.   Anyway...   I'm noticing more and more that I can deal with glaring lapses of personality, and even with stupidity to a point, and generally only dislike people for what they do -- not who they are. I have grown accustomed to tuning out tactless comments, and can converse quite well with some of the more serious cases.   Still, though... I think life needs to more imitate art... to accomodate the intellectually clumsy instead of forcing more and more people to conform and close off. I'm a fuckup but I'm not a bad person, at least I don't think I am, and I'd really like to have a place in this world. Do I need to start a support group for fuckups?   As some of you know, one of the things I believe in is laying the cards on the table... to let people see inside without having to dig, beg, or guess. What I say is what comes to mind at that exact moment. Sometimes I mean it, sometimes I don't... it gets me in trouble often, but how I am in real life is the exact opposite: I say nothing for fear of how it will affect me. With close friends and family I will say what I want to say and sometimes that gets me in huge big trouble as it does on here or anywhere else... but if I didn't speak my mind, I wouldn't speak at all. I just try convincing myself that some of the good I say makes up for some of the bad I say. I want to see some more people talk out their ass so I wouldn't have to feel so alone.   &#13;&#13;

Sad thing is, I'm here all the time, I just have more fun responding to other people's blogs. There's just something about picking on people in their bloggers that makes me feel better about myself. :P  Anyway I've created a new graphic:     It's the Bean as a mime, and he's falsely crying.

      So Mike reminded me of something.  When he said, theReservoirDawg: and all I can think is 'dude, cumshot' :-( ., it reminded me that today... while cleaning my room... I found... MY WATCH!!!!  My late grandmother gave it to me eight years ago; she had ordered it from Marlboro with the little point system and it's a Swiss Army watch and it's so pimp... and I thought I lost it and that hurt. I thought I left it at school a couple years ago and had written it off. That's a cool thing.  My watch can kick your watch's ass.   OH YEAH.&#13;&#13;

      Two review-type thingies.   The Bourne Identity : Matt Damon an action star? It's true. He pulled it off as well as anyone else could, and gave the character the right amount of, what, innocence? I don't know if I could like him in many action movies -- especially since I am not a big Damon fan, but I loved this movie. It was not overacted or CGI-laden, just a good solid action movie with a bit of thinking involved.  Now, I will have to see TBI again since midway through the film I was afflicted with too-much-mello-yello syndrome and I will spare the gory details, just rest assured the film seemed to run another four hours. Jurassic Park II was forever ruined for me for that reason, though it was a shitty movie to start with, but I still enjoyed TBI as much as possible.   HOWEVER! When the movie was over I was like "FINALLY!" but the line... well it didn't move. It took another 10 minutes to get out of the theater, and when I got out of the theater I took advantage of my size and maneuverability, and made a mad dash through all the small women. I felt kinda bad... but then, I also didn't care. It happens.  OBSERVATION: That movie had lots of old people, most on dates, but quite a few on their own. I was surprised... but then I also noticed there were many young kids there; leaving the theater I heard a group of Jr. High age girls saying "But... what happened here, and who was that?" and I had a chuckle.      Blackhawk Down : Wasn't such a bad movie, but interestingly enough that movie has made me think more than any other movie I've seen this year. Seriously... there were maybe 40 characters, all with bald heads and white whom you had to keep track of, so John and his girlfriend asked quite a bit "who is that?" or something similar... and I had the same problem at times.  ANYWAY. Pretty long, and the "funny" things seemed a bit out of place. I always feel pretty shitty after seeing a "based on true story" movies because I question the validity of certain "holes in the plot" or other such things. Such as... at the end,  the people who were fighting the entire time were forced to run alongside the convoy, while the fresh military men were sitting in there saying "sorry no room!"? Did that really happen? That one guy was wounded and he had to run all the way out of town.  I mean really. I think... that's SHITTY if it's true, and if it's not... then what was the point?  When they show all the casings hitting the ground towards the end... what was the point in that? Nothing, really. Things like that scream "RUSHED" to me.  Also a few minor gripes about Josh Hartnett: He looks 17 in this film. His voice is cracking so much you'd think he just started puberty. He's leading them, yet he is taking orders from everyone else. He's looking to others for advice. He is weak and useless until the end. Most of the movie is him preaching. This movie did too much verbal preaching. I think certain moments where the sound stopped and the camera went to slo-mo you can see the point of the film.... but they kept on preaching. That was not necessary. Oh my god this mosquito bite is killing me.     Other things to say: Okay I already mentioned the mosquito bite so that's out of the way...  Sobe Nirvana is good stuff.  I like songs by Sheila Nicholls.  There is nothing cooler than seeing a girl's thong through her skirt.  HOWEVER, there is nothing that ruins that moment worse than seeing her dad staring at the same thing you are. That's creepy and now it's no longer a fantasy, it's a sad/funny anecdote. Bah.  I'm sad. Someone clean my mind of icky thoughts and replace them with nice dirty thoughts!&#13;&#13;

      Okay I have a dilemma. Okay it's a... trilemma.  I'm trying to figure out which nickname for Libby I like best.  In my old archives I saw that I called her spongehead, so  1) Spongehead.  2) Rainbow Brite  3) Leebee  Those are the names I've given her. There are other possibilities but since I've given her these three nicknames I want to know which of the three suits her best. While her "name" is Leebee, she is a spongehead, and it's bright red like Rainbow Brite, so the answer could easily be any of the three, really.  Your thoughts?&#13;&#13;

What I Would Do For Fun If I Was Filthy Rich   All right, first off what good is being rich without war games with your buddies... right? So I will buy dune buggies (or ATV's) for me and all my peeps for a nice all-terrain game of paintball (or laser tag... or something).   I would also buy my own small town next to my Emu ranch, and have an annual "running of the emu" in my small town. You're all invited.  Also, I would buy everything on  urlLink Gadget Masters  and  urlLink Gadget Central  etc. WoOoooOoOOo.  Hmm...   I think I would also buy my block and create an elaborate mansion underneath all the humble little houses. That'd be kewl. People would be like   "Where's Bean's house?"   "Right there"  "You mean that tan/brown one?"  "Um... I guess... and the white/blue one... and like, the rest of the block."  "No no no that's more than one house."  "No... it's not"  Oh yeah. *dx*&#13;&#13;

      Like all of my big posts, this is extremely unpolished and probably makes no sense at all at times, but it's something that's been on my mind I want to talk about.  All right now I know this is old hat for most people... to think yeah yeah the media controls the nation... but when you think about it, WE only think about how the media controls us in a major way, such as leftist propoganda, gender roles, etc.  More and more lately I've been seeing what media is doing on a micro level -- as in, not just advertising products, but altering society to center around a certain product.  What I have in mind in this case is rap music. I mean beer is beer; alcohol is alcohol and if you're going to get drunk, get drunk. But in the 1980s not only were impressional urban youths being told to consume something, they were being told that if they didn't, they did not belong.   I was talking to residue last night about this (well, something marginally different, but we touched on this) that certain things are considered "black" or "white" or "asian" or "latino;" eg. hot sauce. I mentioned liking it and he said "I thought that was a black thing!" and I said "Oh, I just thought it was a fat thing..."  Now that's just a tangent and not my point particularly, the point being that certain things are social "things," BUT WHY? How the hell is there a universal beverage for your race, or hat for your social circle?  Why do people look at Zima and say "homo drink!" or Malt Liquor and say "AHAHA black drink!"?  More importantly... why do all college students drink beer?  Was it as common before Animal House? Yeeeah probably, but I do know that Animal House was the start of people thinking they HAD to do certain things in college: Join frat, drink lots of beer, dress in togas, and be promiscuous. It was no longer what benefitted you the most or was the most fun, it was the universal code.  "Back then you didn't smoke weed because it was the thing to do, you smoked it because it got you high"  --Willie Nelson in "Half Baked."  Then the late 80s and early 90's roll around and rap stars talk about walking around with a joint or a blunt hanging out of their mouth. No longer was it a pasttime, it was a lifestyle. I go drinking on the weekends because I would prefer to handle the week sober, is that so wrong?  Even in the black and white era of movies, there were two constants: 1, when you came home from a hard day's work, you poured yourself a glass of a nondescript alcohol, or, later, had yourself a beer. You know what I like to do after a hard day's work? Shower, drink something that quenches my thirst, and relax. What does alcohol do? It forces you to relax. If you are not relaxed after working hard, then maybe you should go do something else, because you're not exhausted and there's no reason to "wind down." :wtf:  The other constant is cigarettes: When you're a guy and you smoke, you're cool. You're hip. You're aloof. When you're a woman and you smoke you're seductive, exotic and mysterious. Why is that? Because you have bad breath? Brown teeth? You wheeze like a pig? Your car stinks and has a bunch of burn holes on the driver's seat, and when your convertible is opened up the ashes fly out and get in people's eyes?   I know you're probably thinking "Yeah yeah Bean, we know that already," but I was just giving the two classic examples of how the media forms a lifestyle.  Perhaps later on I'll post something about gender roles (I've learned that there's a whole lot more to it than people think.), and perhaps later another topic.&#13;&#13;

      I want to add something on to my earlier post about my name... I just realized that dana and Mike both call me Scott and I haven't known them for TOO long, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  I suppose there has to be a certain level of trust and/or friendship to be called by my real name, as though I knew them in real life.  On a less serious note, I need to spruce up the page so I don't have to beg for people to visit and/or reply. I need some sort of weekly section or something. Short fiction? Drawings of random things on fire? I do not know. Ideas?&#13;&#13;

I didn't work so fast because last time I carried big rocks by hand I squished my index finger and that was unpleasant. So now I'm afraid of rocks...  So anyway I'm still hurting regardless but uh... hey... how you kids doin? ;)  Back to the game...&#13;&#13;

       Undercover Brother   Saw it tonight... was a funny film. Three movie reviews in one week. I don't think I watched three movies over the last year and here I have three in one week. So anyway, I'd have to watch it again and pay attention to detail if I was to give it an Ebertine dissection, but basically it was damn funny, especially since Dave Chapelle is GOD. Half Baked = best movie ever. Anyway... I did think maybe he was overplayed, but... that's not even a bad thing, since he was the funniest person in the movie. And Doogie Hauser...  Tomorrow is pit day. A day in the searing heat bent over picking up rocks for hours and hours... doesn't it sound sexy? OH YEAH YOU KNOW IT!  So I got my grades back... A A- B+ EH For having three classes only they sucked, but for my first semester back after 10 months it... eh... not so bad. These were upper division courses (cept for the fiction writing I got an A in) so I'm pretty proud. Um... yeah. That's about it.  Nobody's replying to my blog anymore. I'm starting to get all sad. :( see? That's me frowning. Heartless people.&#13;&#13;

       As the Buzz Fades...   So now... I'm left bored. My two major haunts, Haligh and Libby have stopped posting because of a pair of losers who need to be thrown down the UP escalator at their local mall, and because of this... I am just uninspired for blogging.  People ask, "Bean, why haven't you updated?" and it's not like I can give them the same reason. Nobody likes me enough to stalk me... if a girl stalked me, I would appreciate it, and probably freak her out because I'm so clingy. I'd be like "Awwww you weren't outside my window today... where were you?!?! DID YOU FIND ANOTHER GUY TO STALK? DO YOU HATE ME NOW?" And she'd file a restraining order. Because I am that cool.  You know what I need? A nice cool 8-) smilie from AIM. I'm addicted to it lately. Cool smilie all over the place. 8-) (H) :cool: depending on where I talk to you, you name it, I have finally learned how to type it on a keyboard so that's what I am. KOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL.  My days... well my days are getting shorter. My nights... longer. I'm having less and less to blog about as the Summer wanes, but fear not loyal (or slutty) readers, I plan on beginning a crime spree right before school starts... and then they can't catch me, as I'll be blending in to the campus crowd!  Now... it has come to my attention that Libby thinks her sole purpose for existing is NOT to entertain me, yet I am trying to figure out a way to convince her otherwise... any suggestions?  I HAVE DECIDED that since nobody will submit to  urlLink Open Mic Night , that I need a new gimmick... a new method of getting people to give a shit... so I got an idea... let me know what you think:  Lately I've been finding myself more and more hard-pressed to recall things from my childhood, and this FREAKS ME OUT man. Distressing as hell. I have decided that if I start writing out memories from my childhood, not only will I remember more, but I'll have them recorded for when I get older and forget everything... and I'd like you all to participate with me.  I'm taking down the "critiques" from the site, as critiquing shouldn't happen on memoirs ;) but I would like you all to write to me describing, IN DETAIL, your earliest memory. Doesn't have to be pretty, doesn't have to be any specific length... just email it to me and I'll tell the world ASAP.  PLEASE participate? Pretty please? *puppy dog eyes*&#13;&#13;

       Kung POW!   I just got done watching this movie and I laughed a whooooooooooole lot. It was just a whole movie of o_O O_o moments, and definitely worth it to go see. If you haven't seen it... see it. That is, if you like stupid humor. This has lots of it. The second scene of the movie was so fucked up... oi. Go rent it and tell me what you think about the second scene, right before the credits ;)  Also, I wanted to discuss Amelie because I finally rented that last week. I really liked it, and wish it could be remade in English so some of the more ADD-riddled people can watch and enjoy it. Definitely an interesting film, with an adorable star. Yeh.  I woke up at like, 5 pm today because of that damned game. &gt;:| Sucks.&#13;&#13;

If you haven't played it or seen anything about it, you're playing God in an environment like Age of Empires, and you are basically apprenticing a newborn baby creature, either a cow, orangutan or a tiger. You can turn into, according to that picture, a bear. You can be a polar bear, I THINK a turtle, a sheep, looks like a black panther... a lion... they get real freaky when you're a bad guy, too. It's great.&#13;&#13;

      PIMPEST SHIT EVER.  All right peeps, check it.  I'm really drunk right now... really drunk... and so is John. We each got like 10 shots extra tonight because....  JOHN WON $250.00!!!!!  That's right. It was like, Hawaiian night or somthing tonight, and whomever got the most lais, male and female, would share  500 350  250 dollars. They would also get a chance to win a jet ski. Well here's the dilly:  The girl who won had 73 lais. John had 16. He got these from a) 5 from our party, b) 3-4 from our party, who got them from guys, but the rest were ALL HIM. He totally whored himself out to the girlz at the bar, a waitress, a beer girl, all for lais. No other guy had ANY lais, so John just straight up won 250 bucks. He gave 20 each to the girls in our party, we bought maybe 20 bucks worth of booze and are splitting the rest. Question for my peeps: What should we buy? I want either a new video game console, or a new weight bench. Beings as I'm a big fatty, I should probably get the wieght bench. What do you, my peeps, suggest?  *edit*The guy who SHOULD have won had like 50 lais but he was ONE FUCKING MINUTE late and John won. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA so we feared getting beaten because the guy was tres pissed that he was too late and John won. We laughed at him. It was great. OH YEAH.  Oh man, we were screaming and celebrating so much tonight. The girlz were all over John for being a stud. It was really great.  Background: It's Janet, my sister in law, Jay's wife's birthday on Sunday... we went out for mexican, embarassed Jay, a lot, had three margaritas, went to the bar, had a double j&amp;c, four j&amp;c's, a jello shot, smirnoff ice, and nine shooters (kamikaze etc). JOHN had: Two margaritas, four long beach iced teas(aka long island with cranberry instead of coke) two jello shots and 10 shots. The Mall of America is brutal on the checkbook, but omg WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO John can I get a WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO?  Also, at the bar the bartender and a waitress were in Bikinis. That broke my heart. :(  All right so um, I can't remember what else. i'll post more kool stuff.  PS: I'm on a pimp new computer now.woo?&#13;&#13;

       urlLink Education Minnesota   I've decided I have a cause I want to fight for. I have shown hints of this, and of that in the past, but nothing (except being pro-life, which isn't worth all the arguing), pisses me off CONSISTENTLY like Jesse "the pigfucker" Ventura's treatment of Minnesota education.  My favorite anecdote on the situation: The University of Minnesota, MY University of Minnesota, is in the top five schools in the nation for medical schools... and their payroll is not even in the top TWENTY!  Pigfucker's argument? "Why would any professor make more than the Governer of Minnesota?" And with that, he demanded salary cuts.  I hate Ventura. I really really do, and I want to beat his ass, too. Actually, I want to beat his son Ray-Ray's ass, because I'm sure Ventura could still rip my heart out. I would beat Ashtray's ass and then maybe in 30 years I will pay a visit to old pigfucker in the 'home.  Feh.     In Canada I was drinking with a few Canucks and we talked about a bunch of stuff -- did I post about this? Doesn't matter -- One thing that came up was that the young woman I was talking to was going to school for... was it sociology? And she was going to be a teacher. When she heard I was in Liberal Arts she didn't wince like Americans do. Why not? Because in Canada, there is GOOD MONEY in teaching. Apparently the teachers union up there owns a large food... manufacturer, or some sort of food chain. Maple Leaf Foods I think it was... anyway, this equals BIG power for teachers, as they don't get pushed around like our teachers do. This equals BIG money for teachers. I think if reform doesn't come soon I will move to Canada, where I can teach and make good money, and any kids I have can have good teachers.&#13;&#13;

I just want you guys, especially if you have a good connection, to go to that site and download some songs and tell me what you think. They're in mp3 format, so they'll take longer, but they won't suck like midis do... but I think the composing for this movie was really great, but overlooked since it's anime and all...  Anywho... I'll be getting a new computer soon... My poor black girl is gonna be put to pasture. I might shed a tear, She and I have had some good and bad times together, as I've discussed recently with Haligh.

      I came up with an idea yesterday, when I saw a well-paid city worker standing around holding a "SLOW" sign.  Why are they paid $15.00 an hour to stand around holding a sign, instead of actually working?  My idea is this: Find beggars to take their place. clean them up, put on an orange vest, and give them a sign. Instead of saying "Will work for food," it will say "SLOW."   They will be paid good money, and they will be working, so it's a win-win situation for all parties! What do you think?&#13;&#13;

       Pit day!   Ugh... so people who know me know I accidentally stayed up until 1:00 AM CST, for my 7:00 AM CST wakeup call, and ended up working till 7:00 PM CST. Okay so I wasn't exactly working the entire time... I'm still a bit shaky loading rocks into a dump truck, though I'm perfectly okay digging and sorting with the skid loader (aka bobcat, tiny front-end loader...?) So anyway, eventually I will be able to load myself... it's not about ability, I can do it fine and have in the past, but one time loading for my dad the ground was too bumpy and I tipped and scraped the back of his truck and ever since then I've been kind of afraid. ANYWAY not like you care.     While out there I worked on my tan (gave my bald head some sun for the first time since I was a baby), and did some walking -- barefoot. Then while wading through the mud, I remembered that there are organisms that like to burrow through the bottom of your feet, and thought to myself... omg so like, am I gonna die from some microorganism now? That would TOTALLY suck.  But I am not really worried since I don't care.  Anyway, while walking I had a little bird nest pointed out to me in the middle of the rocks, and the eggs looked like rocks, and it was just in a little hole in the mud, and there was this baby bird there that appeared to be dead... but it wasn't... it was just playing dead because people were near. Its mother was about 10 yards away ruffling her feathers and screeching bloody murder to take our attention away from her nest. I thought that was sweet -- and very cool how nature works out like that.  Anyway, after eating one of the eggs (just kidding), I went for my walk, and found an egg shell maybe 30 yards away from the nest, in some fresh mud. Iiiiinteresting.  I also saw a pretty good-sized frog, with which I had a long staring contest.... but then I had to get back to work and scared it away :(  If anyone's traveling through Minnesota let me know and I'll try setting up a day at the pit... it's perfectly quiet and beautiful. Especially today, as it was 85 degrees, no clouds, a light breeze and NO HUMIDITY finally. Today was the most perfectest day ever.  That's why I'm in a good mood despite not sleeping much, and you know, having to work. O_o&#13;&#13;

I just get total writer's block when people need me to entertain them. What can I do? Talk about my... life? Nahhh, too many people hate me. If I were talk about my vicious rash, or the trapped gerbil, people would be mocking me all over the place and I would be sad.  So I won't go   on you guys, and I don't plan on   either, but that totally takes away from my webfunnyness.  I still have to clean my room...  My hair is beginning to grow in. It no longer hurts my hand to rub my head.  +5 points to you if you took that wrong.  It rained here, bigtime. Cold cold cold out, which is odd since it was so hot the past few weeks. I actually had to turn the AC off. Going to lunch today I had to pick Josh up and run with the umbrella to keep him dry.  Umm... What? I suppose I should start drawing things on fire like I said I would, before... :)&#13;&#13;

       I am bald!   Yep. As of earlier today, I am officially a member of the follically challenged. It's freaky having NOTHING to move, like... turning my head... nothing. Wind blowing... nothing... Eerie.  Oh yeah, John was the one to cut it. God, I've never seen him as happy as he was to shave my head. o_O  Also, I learned that the little birthmark on the side of my head really isn't small at all, rather basically my head is purple except for a few patches of normal skin. That was an exaggeration. Basically, I've got a big birthmark on my head. O_o  Geeze, the girlz won't be attracted to me anymore.  AHAHAHAHAHAHA woooo hiya.&#13;&#13;

       Pit Duty   It was too hot today, thank God, because I had been picked up to work the pit, and I was on fire. The ramp to the tractor trailer dug into the blacktop because it was really soft. But it's after 3, and if I went to the pit I'd need to go in... under 4 hours. Hmmmm. I wonder if I can survive. It's not very long... but seriously, ever since I got heat stroke out there I've been SCAAAAARED.&#13;&#13;

       Speak and Spell   John pulled out his old Speak &amp; Spell today and put batteries in it. I believe it's as old as I am, and still works fine. Did anyone else have one? These were definitely the coolest inventions ever. Especially back then; the technology was extremely advanced to have something so fun and interactive. Everyone should have one.   Shallow Hal   Eh, it was kinda funny, but I liked the message. I don't really want to talk about it because I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but as far as the movie is concerned, it's... eh. All right. I don't exactly have any detailed critique of the movie, but Farrelly bros. films don't usually elicit much of a response from me.   Happy Fourth   I just dug out my old fireworks. Since Jesse "The Pig Fucker" Ventura legalized ground fireworks, I'm going to have some fun tomorrow. BBQ, then pyromania. It will be great. I have my 500 black cat string ready for the grand finale. That's gonna be one annoying motherfucking piece of work right there ;)&#13;&#13;

      Okay okay this isn't me taking pity on myself, I just want to ask a question: Has anyone ever convinced themselves to mentally ignore a pain mentally, but suffered from the physical byproducts of that stress? As in... I am trying my best to be happy, and acting happy, but I have had a stomach ache for days? O_o  I'm usually not like that. But then, I usually just shut down anyway so I guess I can deal.  I haven't been posting lately. You don't care anyway, because if you read this you probably talk to me off of the site... and if you don't, well, you just don't want to reply to anything, which is fine. I'm not a sweetie, I'm not gay, and I'm not a girl, so I am not attractive to reply to.  Elitist bastards. Where's the straight male asshole love in here!? I ask you WHERE?????&#13;&#13;

This was earlier today, I went to work shoveling and hauling dirt in a wheelbarrow and they wouldn't let me. At one point I was buried up to my shins in dirt, those little tricksters.

        xXx   Here is something I posted on a message board, first regarding Vin Diesel as an actor, and second regarding the movie xXx itself.     First of all what's this whole "HE IS NOT THAT HOT AND CAN'T ACT" bullshit?  Arnold  Sylvester  :wtf:  Which those two won an oscar, or a "sexiest man alive" award?  Exactly! They had bodies. They could act like badasses. They're Vin Diesel. However, Vin imho looks better, is more "realistic" body-wise, has a cool voice AND a cool name, unlike his predecessors. Therefore, Vin superior, Arnold and Sly inferior.  As for the movie... I liked it. It was just an underachieving yet promising first attempt at an American James Bond (Wedge told me this wasn't the first, but I stated that the plot and a lot of the movie were direct ripoffs of Bond, making it more of a direct replica, not just an answer to Bond).  My problems with the film were first and very, very foremost the music. Cheesy and campy at times (if you felt the movie got a bit corny at times you were probably sucked into the music), and that was the score. The soundtrack -- the non-score songs -- were all misplaced. I could not feel any of the music in the film. They even had the corny "Bond-esque" music playing in real tense suspenseful moments, probably to create more levity, so that the crowd could have a "good time."  I think a good huge chunk of the stunts were far too over-the-top, such as the motorcycle(motorbike?) scenes, where he basically jumped off the ramp of a building and was what, 5 stories up in the air, with the fire right on his back without damaging him or even knocking him off course, and he landed seemlessly and kept driving. I started feeling like someone turned the no-grav cheat on in a video game.   Other than that, THIS WAS AN ACTION MOVIE! so you know, things like the convenience of a heat-seaking missile really weren't that ridiculous, considering how James Bond is a really shitty spy, since he always ALWAYS gets caught, and instead of escaping, most of the time people either let him live, or save him. Things like that remind me why action/spy movies are not supposed to be subjected to such rigorous scrutiny that people tend to use lately -- not just with these movies, but all movies. Every single movie is expected to make you think, yet it's the movies which try too hard to make you think and fail that are given the most applause. Pfffft.&#13;&#13;

      I have decided I can't have my blog being a place for self pity anymore. I do not like drama, and I should not partake in self pity. Pity is for the silly. While I will not slip into denial about me being a grade-a major loser, I'm deleting my whining posts from the last few days because, well, why the hell did I post them in the first place? I would like to say I am over my past but as you can see I obviously am not, and that is what makes me so lame.  So anyway.  urlLink Here  is a link to the stair-descent game, courtesy of Vy. It's very great. Let me know your high score. A warning from Vy: Don't try posting your high score online, it will crash your system.  I took pictures of how nasty parts of my room look before cleaning, and I've stalled midway through the cleaning process... but I will get it done before the month is through, oh yes I will! Or die trying! :( Does anyone want to help? I will pay.&#13;&#13;

My reply:    Hahahaha sorry about that... it's a little extra that I use to bug my viewers, it shouldn't be too hard to figure out how to  turn it off... 1) when the page loads, hit escape, or STOP on your browser. 2) Click on Comments, the music will stop. 3) Double click the little bell/horn icon in your system tray and turn off Synthesizer/MIDI, if you hate it so much.  Sorry to lose your business, you were a valued customer and I wish you luck in the future!  o_O  -Bean    I will be changing my MIDI soon, I've just been in the midst of a computer change, so ya know...

      The time... 9:00 AM  The breakfast... a dry toasted onion bagel.  All I have to say now, is this morning strikes me as painfully hard to swallow. O_o  I already finished my milk unfortunately, and now I am wasting time away until my bus comes in an hour and change.  I haven't had anything really to say the past while, which I'm sure has broken the hearts of one person: my imaginary internet stalker. That's right, I still want a stalker, so if you're interested in stalking me please drop me a line. Chances are you'll have a better chance of being chosen as my stalker if you're female, because I wouldn't be as flattered/scared if a guy did it.   Anywho my classes are annoying and so long that when I come back I am usually feeling noncreative, so...  Look at this, even now I wanted to post just to say something and it's totally just me mumbling, or scribbling, or whatever you want to call it.  Sooooooooooooooooooooooooo...  -Vikings suck -Blade II was good, but a bit too cartoony in places. -Charmed is a wonderful show. Too much clothing involved -I'm serious about the stalker thing. I'm lonely... so running away screaming from a nice girl would really brighten up my day. -Art scholars are PRETENTIOUS and I hate them. -So are most writers. Shall I become the first writer who isn't a chain smoker/alcoholic? -Geoffry Chaucer should have written in modern English, or at least in complete French so people would TRANSLATE HIM god damn it -Vikings suck -Cept Chris Hovan who will continue to rawk until he's in the Pro Bowl. -Oh and Moe Williams, who is way underutilized in the Vikings' "tire out the other team's offense by continually giving them the ball" scheme.  PS: What is with the phrase "out like a fat kid in dodge ball?" I am offended... I was a fat kid and I often won dodgeball. It's not about being fat, it's about being fat, slow and uncoordinated. I dodged as well as the skinny kids, and caught balls better than them.  Anyway, consider that me signing out... bye bye boyzzzzz and girlzzzzz&#13;&#13;

       Alright.  I've been on the road a few days now.  Things are better than I could have hoped.  Inspiration is around every bend in the road!  My first night was rough.  I got caught in that huge thunderstorm and had to camp out in a thorn bush for the night.  Soggy and bloodied but still undeterred I stumbled out of the bush with the first light and got on my bike.  Small town after small town went by, each amounting to little more than a general store and a cluster of houses.  I crossed the ontario border and into farm country, stopped to talk to the little round rolly-polly country folk and ate fresh produce the whole way.  By the end of the day I was in Alexandria, a big town in these parts.  I met a 67 year old man who was an environmental fanatic.  He had turned his house into a recycling depot and his back yard into a composting system.  He pedalled around on his little bike all day collecting recyclables and "dumpster diving" to salvage what other people considered garbage, but which he could make some use of.  The whole house was full of salvaged things, the floor had collapsed from the weight of them to the earth below (no basement thank goodness).  He had set up a system of step ladders to navigate the collapsed floor with his tiny little 67-year-old footsteps.  After several lectures about the environment he took me to the basement of an insurance company that let him cook meals there, and we had a salvaged dinner. (I believe I had spaghetti with a lovely sauce of McDonald's sweet and  sour sauce)  We made our way back to his house/recycling depot, picking up every scrap of paper along the way and he let me sleep on a salvaged bed and read some salvaged newspapers to go to sleep by.  In the morning he showed me the coal cathedral where the bishop used to live and finally let me go after I finally convinced him I would not stay on to steward to take over the local organic agriculture farm.  I made a long ride to the town of Kemptville where a gas station let me camp in the little wooded area on their property.  After hiding my gear in the bush I decided to explore the local tavern.  It appears that in ontario, young people do not go to bars.  The clientelle were all over 50, so I tucked myself away in a corner and wrote.  The waittress caught my eye and I started a conversation with her.  Her name was Lindsey.  I half jokingly invited her to a bowl of soup at my lovely gas-station hideaway.  To my shock and surprise she accepted, so I waited for her to finish her shift.  She drove me back to my site and we had a lovely hot chocolate in the gas station parking lot.  After parting ways, I realixed I had not given her any contact information, so I went to bed disappointed.  When I woke up in the morning, I decided I would try to find her and invite her to breakfast.  I went back to the bar and asked if they knew where she lived.  (She had taken me to her house briefly the night before and had invited me to return in the morning, but I could not find it.  Damn memory.)  The bartender called her for me and she invited me to her place and gave me directions.  I got there in no time and she made me an incredible breakfast.  We talked and then her mother came home and invited me to stay the night.  After a little while I accepted her generous and sincere offer.  Well, I tell you, I've never eaten so well in my life!   They must have been the most generous people in the world.  I suspect they would have given me the entire contents of the house if I could carry it on my bike.  Lindsey's father came home, thirsty for a beer to quench the pwerful thirst he'd acquired working in the heat of the local foundry.   They smoked pot on the porch and told me about the town as the sun went down.  Lindsey went to work again and I followed her, but left the pub soon from boredom.  I can't say much for the friday-nightlife in Kemptville, I'm afraid.  I went back to Lindsey's house and went to sleep in her bed.  In a few hours she joined me and slept next to me till afternoon.  I left that wonderful family with a heartfelt thank you and their best wishes.  Leaving Lindsey with a peck on the cheek, I got back on the road.  I didn't bike long that day, having left late.  Also, the heat had become unbearable which cut the distance I could travel in half.  I set up camp just outside a little tourist-trap town called Merrickville.  Though it was very pretty, and the tourists told me how friendly the locals were, I found them cold and uninviting, and thoroughly penny-pinching.  So much for tourist towns.  Their hospitality was nothing compared to the real small-town hospitality I had just experienced.  I got back on the road with no regrets the next morning.  Well, the next place I stopped was Perth.  I camped in the "Last duel" park, where two men had shot each other over a woman some 100 years ago.  It was the last duel-related fatality in canada.  Apparently, both men were in love with the same woman, and settled their dispute with single shot pistols.  The one man was killed on the spot, and the other crawled to her doorstep and died there.  That's as close to the real story as I got.  This sleepy little town went to bed at 8:00pm.  After that, the locals disappeared and the pubs were closed!  One single pub stayed open later, to the late hour of 9:00pm.  I went there and had a lemonade and met a delightful man named Ray.  He was a storyteller, an ex-newfoundland minister who had been booted from the church because he preached that the people should read the bible themselves and come to their own conclusions.  Blasphemous!  Now he regaled me with tales and jokes and general good cheer until the bar closed.  I mentioned to him my lack of reading material, that every bookstore I arrived at was closed, so he offered me some of the books he was going to give away.  I took a couple of books of the short writings of Thoreau and a book about Jung.  After talking for a while, and being declared a fellow member of the church of the peripheral-visionary, we parted ways.  He left me with "I'll probably see you in prison some day!".  Now I'm back on the road, where I finally found a place to access the internet.  I am in a local continuing education and employment center that offers public internet access, where I am very happy to escape the still unbearable heat.  I'm a couple of kilometers outside of Charbot lake, whose shore will soon have a tiny green tent on it for the night. &#13;

       I'm back on the road after stopping for a week to visit Dave in Waterloo.  Let's see, where did I leave off?  Sharbot lake.  Well, let me tell you, there is nothing more lonely and desperate than a man alone in the wilderness, sick as a dog.  I came down with the nastiest head cold and spent the night writhing on the shore of lake sharbot with a migraine.  I don't think I slept at all that night.  I started out again with the sun, feeling as weak as a kitten.  The wind had picked up over night so I fought my way all the way to Kaladar, "The little town with a big heart", so the sign said on the way in.  Well, I decided that I was going to hitchhike down the 7 a little bit, because I was already exhausted.  I don't know how long I held my thumb up, but I didn't get anywhere.  So much for the "big heart".  So I got back on my bike and kept pushing.  After a while, somewhere between Kaladar and Actinolite, I stopped next to a chip wagon to read my map at the picnic tables. "Nanna and Papa's chip wagon" it was called.  It wasn't long before "Papa" came out to ask me where I was from and where I was going.  So I told him.  Well, wouldn't you know it but he was heading my way and had a pick-up truck for my bike and would be happy to take me along if I would just wait for him to go get the oil changed and pick up some "hamburgs" for Nanna.  I never even asked!  So I waited around for him, and in the mean time, Nanna gave me ice cream and peaches and pie, telling me that her's is the chip stand that's "full of love", and that as long as they make enough to survive, they're happy to give away the rest.  Well Nanna (aka Gloria) told me that Papa (aka Jim) and her had been together 49 years, had five kids, even had great-grandchildren, one of whom is eleven years old already!  Nanna told me all about her family and her life until Jim got back, and we packed up the pickup and drove down the 7, stopping at their home in Actinolite to feed the cat, and at Havelock for coffee (or in my case hot chocolate) - Jim's treat.  We kept down the 7 and by-passed Peterborough as Jim told me what this country needs is another war, and less immigrants, because otherwise we wouldn't know who to fight, as well as frequent jokes about how much faster it was going in a car as opposed to a bike and how I sure was making it further than I must've thought I would this mornin'.  Though I obviously don't agree with his political views, I nonetheless enjoyed his company all the way to Oshawa.  I biked a little more that night and pitched camp in an abandonned baseball field in Ajax, after having a peculiar encounter with an old woman and her dog (I don't want to talk about it).  At dawn I was back on my bike and it wasn't long before I was in Toronto.  I didn't like it there.  It was ugly and the people were mean.  Consequently, I had my most productive day of biking to date.  I barrelled through Toronto at a break-neck pace.  I made it all the way to Guelph by nightfall, and went down to the local bar.  Now for those of you who have not been to Ontario, Ontario is a fascist state.  Upon entry into the bar I was told that my bags were not allowed inside the bar, could not be stored behind the bar, that my I.D. was insufficient (I had enough I.D. to cross the border, but not to get into an Ontario bar) oh and by the way could I take off my bandana since they are not permitted either. After trying a few bars, I found one that would accept my identification and my Bandana (though notably not my bags) and stayed there for the evening while keeping a watchful eye on my bags outside.  I met a nice fellow who decided to make up for all the mean people I'd met so far in Guelph and we shot some pool and made fun of the tough-guy bartender.  I met a nice bartender named Kelly and we chatted when she had time, and we exchanged numbers before I left.  I met some drunk frat-boy types who offered their couch to me for the night, and I accepted.  With the morning I left again and made Waterloo in no time.  I noticed I was quite sore from the day before's exertions.  I got to Dave's (David de Koos, my oldest friend who had been studying at Waterloo university) and crashed out on the couch.  I stayed there for a week, going out in the evenings to the local bars, but found them to be quite awful.  People go to bars around there to get really drunk or pick up women.  No exceptions.  Well, no exceptions but me.  I went down on saturday to visit kelly in guelph, and we spent the day before her shift together. It was fun and Kelly turned out to be quite nice.  We parted ways and I jumped on a bus that was going to a Hoedown of all things, on a whim.  I found myself in the middle of the country where a few country bands were playing in an old barn, and I listened to what turned out to be very good music as a thunderstorm raged outside.  I snuggled up to a lovely girl named Olivia whom I'd met along the way and who I seemed to have instant chemistry with.  We left together and got a lift back to Guelph, and we went for a walk in the rain holding hands.  It was wonderful until she decided that the fact that I was leaving meant she couldn't get close to me, even in the platonic sense.  I would try to change her mind over the course of my week in Waterloo, but to no avail.  In the morning I found my way back to waterloo.  I spent the rest of the week in that beer-swilling, culturally destitute pick-up bar called Waterloo...  Well maybe that is a bit more harsh than I intended.  Nonetheless, I was happy to leave Toronto and its satellites behind me for the open road.  I biked out of Waterloo to Woodstock where I camped for the night behind a couple of billboards.  Tim Horton's and some type of lubricant as I remember.  Also, I was five feet from the railroad tracks I would discover much to my surprise when the first train came roaring and blaring by.  I swear, I was feeling the ground underneath me just to make sure I wasn't ON the tracks.  It was a cold night, though I didn't feel it since I was still a little bit tipsy from Charles Dicken's Pub, apparently the only decent place in woodstock.  I had met a Scotsman who insisted upon buying me pint after pint of guiness.  He was apparently hiding from his wife who would be giving birth in a week, and it was quite apparent that he would be in big trouble when he got home.  The bartender jokingly blamed me for his getting as drunk as he was, because "he wouldn't have drunk so much had he not found you to talk to."  He apologized for not giving me a place to stay for the night, but he was in enough trouble with the wife as it was.  Back on the road in the morning.  I passed a couple of little towns before hitting London, finally a town with a sense of humor!  My first sight in London was a strip club called Famous Flesh Gordon's that advertised "We cranked our AC so the girls can cut glass.  Come in for a peek, any more than that and you might lose an eye."  Next to it was a bakery called "Buns Master" which advertised this week's special as white bread.  They must get the most disoriented and confused customers, shocked at having stumbled into an actual honest to goodness bakery. Every block in London held a similar gem, such as a sex shop bearing the slogan "Partners come &amp; go, and so do batteries!", St. Patrick's church which had a cheasy likeness of St. Patrick encased in some sort of equally comical protective bubble (You would have to see it to believe it), a store called Money 4 "Nothing" (which had in small print next to it "+ tax"), etc.  I'm currently in London's public library.  I don't know where I'll be tonight, but I'd like to hang around London if I can. &#13;

       Alright.  I've just discovered my other e-mail address is marc.lajoie@mail.mcgill.ca, NOT marc.lajoie@mcgill.ca.  E-mails that were sent to the latter are now in the infinite limbo of cyberspace.  I got the e-mail that were sent to mlajoi4@po-box.mcgill.ca, but I don't know how much longer this e-mail address will continue to exist.  So, in summary, marc.lajoie@mail.mcgill.ca is the preferred address.  Thank you and goodnight. :) &#13;

       Well, where oh where did I leave off?  Right, London.  London lost its sense of humor as I got more towards its core and became a rich-kid university town.  I did find a really cool bartender named Sabrina, who kept me entertained for the majority of the evening.  Incidentally, if you're listening Sabrina, go to Halifax, I have no doubt whatsoever that you will win, especially if they get to know your personality.  While I was in London, I got rejected from another bar due to my bandana, but debated with the bouncers and managers for a good half an hour before leaving. (Fascists) :)  I then went down the road to a bar where the students from the business school were congregating for a karaoke competition.  I stole a name tag and faked my way through the night as a business student, complaining about courses and such.  A girl asked me if I was on the list and I said "no"; but she added me to the list if I promised to bring in my application tomorrow.  So I had a blast, free alcohol all night AND I qualified for the finals.  Who's the man?  I finished off the night back at Sabrina's bar, the Keltic Knot, and slept in the park for the night.  Back on the road, I passed a town called Morpeth.  Apparently, Morpeth was once called Jamesville, but the deeds of a british philanthropist named Morpeth induced the townspeople to consider a name change.  In order to decide whether to change the name, two barrels were found and filled with whisky.  Those for the name change would put their whisky in one barrel, those against in the other.  Whichever side had the most whisky in the end would have it their way.  Now that's a system!  I'm sure by the end of the night, no one cared either way!  I think I spent the night camped outside Blenheim, though at the moment I have no recollection of that night whatsoever.  Strange.  The next day I biked all the way to Kingsville, Canada's southernmost town.  Kingsville has a ferry that takes you to Pelee island, and then from Pelee to Sandusky, Ohio., which I planned to take.  I found a beautiful undiscovered beach on the shore of lake Erie where I set up camp.  What a spot; wilderness behind me; sand underneath me; endless water before me.  Who could ask for more in life? I stayed a couple of nights there, went out to the local Kingsville bar at night and met cool folks such as Don Smith &amp; Greg Freeman. (I promised I'd mention them)  It rained alot the next day and I got very wet, but by the time saturday morning came around I was dry enough and ready to get on the ferry.  I took the ferry to Pelee, had a good time shooting pool and socializing in the southernmost tavern in Canada, and got back on the ferry to the United States.  The tiny ferry had only a handful of people on it.  I stood at the front of the boat and watched the islands pass behind me.  I can't describe the excitement I felt as they raised the American flag, incating we'd crossed the border.  I looked behind me at Canada receding on the horizon and at my bike at the stern of the boat, against a background of endless water, and for the first time really wished I had a camera, so that my friends and family could see this.  I arrived at Sandusky's port and told the customs officials the ABSOLUTE TRUTH (novel tactic, I know).  They let me in to their country despite my appalling honesty and I wandered the town for a while.  Wow, what a difference!  For the first time I experienced racial segregation and real racism.  The black community and the white community interacted only peripherally, and often antagonistically.  They even attended different bars!  It was crazy!  While the population was mixed outside the bar, when I got inside, it was only white.  Someone informed me that the only reason a black person would be in there would be to "score a white woman".  Nonetheless, I had fun there as a girl band called Monkey Love rocked the joint.  It was the first live music I had heard in a while.  I went all goo-goo eyed over the guitar player, an incredibly attractive fiery red-head who held the entire place in her spell, even know she wasn't the "star".  I talked to her and she got me free drinks all night.  Her name was, quite appropriately, Angel.  If I'd only had more time!  I also met a really cool guy named Gregory Noblin, someone who didn't fit in in Sandusky but who would have fit in wonderfully in Montreal.  He told me to call him along the way if I needed anything, anything at all, including money.  He was cool and reminded me of my cousin Martin.  I camped that night behind a plastic surgeon's office, figuring doctors don't work weekends.  I took off the next day and had some bike trouble along the way.  I had two flat tires in one day!  I was exhausted by the time I changed it a second time, but a baptist minister invited me to dine with his family and I accepted.  What an experience!  He had 6 kids; his sister nine.  They were all home-schooled and I'll wager that all the kids slept in the same bed.  In short, I had dinner with the Waltons.  The girls all wore aprons and kerchiefs on their heads; the men farmed for a living.  Three generations of the family all lived there, and I'm sure it will soon be four.  I was politely informed that I am going to hell, though they were quite friendly about it  (I guess they meet a lot of the hellbound).  I had a good time and got back on the road refreshed.  I camped out in the middle of nowhere, and resumed in the morning.  The next day was long and tiring.  The incline and the wind were against me; by the end of the day I was exhausted and wanted nothing more than to jump in a lake.  I found one and headed straight for it.  I stayed in Delaware state park and met a lovely couple of grandparents who fed me until my seams were busting.  I stayed an extra day there and camped on their site so I didn't have to pay.  They run a trucking company and offered me a ride on a truck to where I'm going when I need it, and gave me their number.  I also met their son who was my age, and we went to the local town of Delaware to play drinking games with his friends.  Great people!  I slept again in Delaware state park.  In the morning I said goodbye to my newfound friends and headed to Delaware.  Ohio Wesleyen University, an arts college, resides in Delaware Ohio.  I took the opportunity to audit a class on Socrates and enjoyed it thoroughly.  I met a whole bunch of university students who are currently giving me a place to stay until the hurricane blows over -- Fantastic people.  I've been having a blast partying with them, and especially with a lovely girl named KT Labadie.  I've peaked her interest in Montreal and I think she may be heading up there at some point.  I may need some of you to show her a good time.  Also, since I've been here, I've made a connection that will aid me in the future:  I now have an in with the Hopi tribe in Arizona, and it seems likely that I will be allowed to live with them for a while when I get there.  I have found the people of Ohio to be generous and kind.  I even had some guy stop me on the road and insist on giving me forty dollars american to help me on my way.  He insisted so vigourously I eventually had to accept the money!  Anyways, I'll be back on the road soon and will have more stories to tell, if anyone out there is listening. &#13;

       Hello Hello friends and well-wishers!  Later today I'm going to write another update.  A lot has happened since London, and especially since I got to the united states.  I'm currently in Delaware, Ohio. (For anyone who knows where that is)  I'm near the state captital, Columbus.  I'm just trying to piece together the last week in my mind before I start writing.  Stay tuned! &#13;

       Well, this will be an interesting update.  Kentucky: what a place.  It was raining when I started out and I stopped for a while to read some e-mail at the local library and to update my site (the previous update).  I got a letter from KT that said that she looked forward to me riding towards her, not away from her.  It rained all day and I was soaked to the bone when I got to Falmouth, Kentucky.  I stopped at the local catholic church and asked a nun who lived there if there was a dry place to stay in town - a youth hostel or something.  She told me "no" but said that her neighbor - a policeman - might know of a place or at least be able to instruct me.  I told her that I did not want to cause a commotion but was just curious.  She insisted that I might as well ask since they were probably just drinking coffee anyways.  Well I hung around with her for awhile waiting for the policeman to show up as she told me about the church's history: how the flood had destroyed it a few years back and about the old bell ringer and such.  I let her know that she didn't have to keep me company while I waited, but she said she was happy to.  Well, the officer showed up and I realized my error.  I was immediately spread across the railing and searched.  My ID was seized and I was taken into custody.  I was now the subject of a "terri-stop".  Incidentally, for those of you who haven't figured it out, terri is short for terrorist.  I was given the third degree as they checked my criminal record and tried to verify my identity.  I was told to "go back to Canada".  I was also told that I was not permitted to stay in town, or camp outside of it.  I was also informed of their ability to "drum-up charges" and put me in prison.  I was told that any attempt to camp would at best result in my arrest, at worst at my being shot.  The officer also told me that the nun was "scared to death" when she called.  Damn, that's one tough nun not to show it at all and to keep me occupied until the police came. :) Incidentally, the nun never even called the police directly, so that was obviously not true.  During my time there, people from all over town called to find out what was going on.  Even the mayor called for an update on the terrorist crisis.  I think my worst error in the whole affair was mentioning that I was against the war in Iraq.  I was informed that they were going to blow up Iraq whether I liked it or not.  The police officer - who had seen combat twice, he informed me - kept asking me questions like "Have you ever seen your friend get blowed up right next to you?  Have you?!".  I tried to explain that I was just trying to see the world, to which he responded "Then join the army!".  It was a pointless conversation.  Eventually, after confirming that my ID was legitimate and that Quebec was indeed a place, I was released - in some sense.  Since it was now too dark to be on the roads and I was not allowed to camp in that county, and since the next county would probably be advised of my presence and told to give me similar treatment, I had to think of a way out of Kentucky.  I looked through my pocket and found a card from the truckers I had met up near Delaware.  I called the number on the card to find out if a truck was nearby, and soon help was on the way.  I sat in the police lobby - incidentally, the only place I was allowed to be in town - and read Siddhartha from  cover to cover.  It was excellent and particularly poignant considering my situation.  A few moments after I finished the book, help arrived and my bike and I were transported back to Delaware, Ohio.  I'm now living with the Mundls, the owners of the trucking company.  I asked if I could help out in some way the next morning after my rescue from Kentucky.  Ms. Mundl thought about it for awhile and eventually sent me on a mail-run to Delaware.  The post-office was a block away from KT's house.  I could see the observatory next to her place.  I was riding towards her, not away from her, less than a day after I read her letter.  What does it mean?  What is left to be done here?  I will be in the Delaware region until monday night when my bike will be placed in the trailer and myself in the cab of a truck heading westward.  I have three days to figure it out.   &#13;

       I had never felt a cosmic connection with someone -- an irresistable force drawing me towards someone as if we had some history of which I was unaware;  I had never met KT Labadie.    My time at Ohio Wesleyen University was a blast, all told.  The people there welcomed me with an open heart.  When it was finally time to go, people thanked ME for staying with them, oddly.  I don't think they realize how much their kindness and hospitality meant to me -- how much they rescued me.  I got back on the road and camped the night in a little wooded area.  I was perhaps less discreet than I had intended, because the next morning a police car came by, notified by the locals, to check me out.  The police officer was very friendly and we chatted for a while.  He told me stories about a man called Herbert "Funk" Wilson, who used to live in the woods around there.  Apparently, people were nervous about him too, at first, but then people got used to him.  He let me know I wasn't breaking any laws, but the people around simply wanted to make sure I wasn't dangerous.  He was very friendly, and put off his policemanly duties for a while to shoot the breeze with me.  He left me with a hearty handshake and drove away.  One of the local residents ran across the street to give me some food, and ran away again before I could properly thank her.  I think sometimes people are just looking for an excuse to be kind.  The next day I biked down to Yellow Springs, Ohio.  What a beautiful town!  I recommend visiting it and going to the most gorgeous wooded area I've ever found: Glen Helen.  Yellow Springs is the home of Antioch college, an extremely liberal school where there is no grading and everyone makes their own program, where it's not unusual to see naked people on swings and running through the trees, and where pot is smoked openly and outdoors, often in the company of the professors.  When I called my father from there, I think I was having trouble staying coherent, since there was a bare-breasted -- and very attractive -- woman running around in front of me.  I stayed a couple of nights on their couch; No one seemed to mind.  What a peculiar place... Southern Ohio has a brilliant program whereby they turn old railroad tracks into bike trails.  It just so happened that one of them came right to Yellow Springs.  I followed this beautiful trail down to Xenia, where a kind man named John gave me a wooden train whistle I didn't know what to do with.  I got back on the path which took me right to Cincinatti  (The only knowledge I'd previously had of Cincinatti was from WKRP in Cincinatti, and really all I remembered was the theme song).  I went to the village tavern and saw a really good band.  They were more or less playing exclusively for me, as the rest of the bar's population were much more interested in the Karaoke downstairs and in doing "white boy dances", as the band leader told me.  I met a professional comedian who amused me for a good part of the evening.  I gave him my train whistle and he spent the rest of the night running around and warning people about the train, and, when they had their backs turned, blowing the whistle.  He got much more of a kick out of it than I would have.  I hung around with the staff after the bar closed.  They gave me cake. The bouncer at the bar, a fellow named Virgil (after his great grand-daddy), took me in for the night, made me breakfast, and drove me across the Ohio River.  He was an incredibly nice guy -- and a riot, too -- and even gave me a book to read: Siddartha. My brief experience with Cincinatti was a positive one, despite what people say.  So here I am, in God-knows-where, Kentucky, sending my love. &#13;

       Well, during my time staying with the Mundls in Delaware, I went out drinking with Kurt (their son) and his friends.  Needless to say, they drank me under the table and by the end of the night I was ill from a belly full of american beer - Rolling Rock, I think: poison.  I had fun that night but had to spend the next day recovering.  I had sent KT an e-mail the day before telling her that I was back in town, and the reply arrived in the afternoon.  She was up in Cleveland with her parents, but my letter caused her to jump in her car and race towards Delaware without explanation as to why she was skipping out on dinner.  Kurt invited me to go to some sort of arcade - or something of the sort - but I was on my way to meet KT.  It was strange.  I had almost convinced myself that the magic I felt was imaginary, or the product of isolation, but on seeing her again I could no longer deceive myself.  I entertained the idea of staying; she entertained the idea of coming with me.   We both knew that it was not to be - for now.  In May, KT graduates from university.  I gave her the compass around my kneck and, this time, she pedalled away from me; God, I hate irony.  I walked the 10 miles back to where I was staying, on some dark Ohio road under the stars, and dreamt about the future.  The next day I hung around the Mundl's house during the day and helped out with the paperwork for the trucking company.  The Mundls treated me to a feast at Outback - a retaurant/grill - and brought me to Columbus to meet up with Dick Dresbach, the trucker who would conduct me westward.  We left the warehouse at 2:00am and started out west.  During the few days I lived in his truck, I lived the trucker's life - all except for the driving.  We would make several stops in various places through the southern U.S., in Kentucky (argh), Missouri, Arkansas and finally Texas.  During this trip, I learned all sorts of trucker lingo, conversed with truckers, was to my delight mistaken for a trucker, unloaded cargo (lumping, they call it), ate at truck stops, sneered at Peterbilt trucks and their drivers with their holier-than-thou attitudes, listened to people picking fights over the CB radio and slept in the top bunk while the road roared by underneath me.  This morning I found myself in Fort Worth, Texas - just outside of Dallas.  I've found the people of Texas so far to be extremely friendly and welcoming.  I'm now sitting in the parker county public library in Aledo, Texas.  Biking today, I watched the trees shrink and nearly disappear, and the cacti begin to replace them.  Desert is on the way. &#13;

       Well, the night was difficult in Texas.  I stopped by the police station to find out the local laws on camping, but I couldn't find an officer.  I accidentally walked into a Texas jail.  What a strange place.  It reminded me of a post office.  It seemed like such a regular place, a place where it is common to go.  People - normal people, not freaks - were waiting to pick up friends or relatives.  I got the distinct impression that one did not have to do a whole lot to end up there.  My paranoia about Texas prison was enhanced by the fact that every second street corner seemed to hold some prison or prison related facility.  When I finally found an officer to talk to, I found out the laws on camping are unforgiving in Texas; Sleeping in the wrong place can put you in prison for six years.  I asked him if there was any place I could sleep without paying a fortune, and after much brow-furrowing, he decided that a little picnic area 8 miles out of town would probably fit the bill.  Picnic area my ass.  It was a patch of grass, completely exposed, five feet off of the highway.  It was really just a widening of the burm.  I pitched my tent surrounded by garbage, and nervously climbed inside of it.  I was woken up when an empty beer bottle bounced off the top of my tent, a few inches from my face. I unzipped my tent to peak and was greeted by the sight of rowdy texans, drinking and laughing obnoxiously.  I zipped back up and hoped not to be seen.  Eventually, they left and morning came - not by any means a pretty morning.  I could tell immediately that rain was a strong possibility.  I had no idea at the time that the part of the country I had woken up in is known as "Tornado Alley".  Good choice Marc :)  I started out gingerly as the rain started falling: lightly at first, but then I felt the tension in the air. "Here it comes!" I said to myself and the thunder storm that would last the whole day (and maybe more) began.  Miserably, I continued down the road.  I didn't make it far though: Something punctured my tire.  In the pouring rain I went about the task of changing my tire, as each passing car or truck thought nothing of raising a tidal-wave that crashed over me, miserably loosening bolts and prying the rubber off the wheel.  Someone came out of the house I was in front of and inquired if I was "alright".  I think it was more of a "what are you doing here?".  When he determined that I was legitimately fixing a tire, he returned to his house.  He did not offer any sort of assistance.  After changing my tire and cutting my hand in the process I got back on the road.  If there was ever a day that made me feel like stopping, turning around and going home, it was this one.  I stopped by a restaurant, had a bowl of hot soup, and asked them if there was a public library for the town of Mineral Wells, Texas, which I found myself in.  There was, and I found it.  I holed up in the library and read my book - "The World According to Garp", an excellent novel with a wit I appreciate.  I looked at my map to determine how much Texas was left:  Too much.  "Screw this" I said to myself aloud, with no library patrons in the immediate vicinity to SHHH me (Though you KNOW they would have).  I got a phone book from the librarian and looked up Greyhound.  I called and found out that yes, there was a stop in mineral wells, and yes, they would take me to Flagstaff, Arizona.  The texas library, of course, would not let me use one of their many unoccupied computers to use the internet and find out if there was anyone to meet in Flagstaff without apllying for a library card, paying fifteen dollars and waiting a week to recieve the card in the mail;  I would have to take my chances in Flagstaff.  The librarians had no sympathy for my predicament.  After some cajoling, the librarian sugested I use the local three-dollar transportation service to bring me to the greyhound stop.  After arguing with the service for awhile about whether they would let me bring the bike in their van, I gave up and left the library with uncertain directions, 45 minutes until the bus and no money, in a town I was unfamiliar with.  Fortunately, I found a bank, got some money and made it to the greyhound stop with little time to spare.  Of course, Greyhound does not and WILL not transport bicycles, the clerk informed me.  "Let me out of TEXAS!" I howled at the poor Greyhound clerk.  I had tried to be nice, I really had;  It was time for EVIL.  I make it a point not to be dishonest for personal gain; I had not, of course, previously been to Texas.  Using my fairly well honed talents for manipulation and half-truths, I arrived at Flagstaff, bike and all, the next day.  I tracked down a youth hostel in the town.  I am now clean and dry and well fed.  I do not, however, miss Texas. &#13;

       For those of you who are wondering:  I am not dead.  I will give you another update shortly.  Until then, be assured that I'm healthy and happy and keeping myself occupied.  Send me an e-mail and let me know how you're doing (especially you dead-beats who haven't e-mailed me yet :) ); I'm starting to wonder if I'm talking to myself - not that that would be a new thing. marc.lajoie@mail.mcgill.ca &#13;

       And, now, ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages... The circus continues.  I am getting my kicks on route 66, up in the arizonian mountains, near the grand canyon, in a town called Flagstaff.  I am living and working at a hostel on old route 66, engaging in nightly drunken revelry with my room-mates: a tiny hot-headed lesbian named Megan; and Dylan, alaska's answer to buddha (As well as a whole cast of interesting freaks that populate the hostel).  I have met people from all over the world while here, made contacts on every continent (except antarctica, dammit), and am now considering interesting new prospects (to be described later in this update).  I work three hours a day cleaning and am given room and board in return, as well as - wait for it - fifteen dollars a week! :) I am missing my family and friends from montreal (as well as the friends I have met along the way), and have been feeling quite homesick for the last few days.  Your e-mails have made me feel much better, though, and I love the heck out of you guys.  Apparently, halloween is a HUGE holiday out in the west - who knew?  I dressed as a scarecrow, stuffing hay in my jacket and sporting a charmng green straw hat, and had a blast as the city went wild.  But almost every night here is wild -  must be the people I associate with.  I have also had an interesting, though rough, time in my romantic life.  An androgynous woman and a beautiful and charming one-eyed french woman are among the list of romantic interests who have pulvarized my still-beating heart :)  Women!  I have also happened upon a group of francophones who inhabit the town of flagstaff, and I have been enjoying their company.  It has been really good to speak french again. It relieves some of my home-sickness.  I think, though, that I will be leaving here soon and going up to the Hopi reservation.  It should be a great place to learn.  After the Hopi reservation I think I will go down to San Francisco, where I hope that Richard (my brother) will come visit me, as well as KT (and anyone else who wishes to join me).  I'm very much looking forward to San Fran; I've heard good things about it.  After that, well, I met a kiwi (new zealander) who offered me a place to stay in absolute paradise, where she lives.  In order to get there, a friend of her's who built himself a tiny trimeran (a little sail-boat) may let me sail with him across the pacific to new zealand.  It has always been my dream to be on water, out of sight of land.  I hope it happens!  Well, there are a trillion things that I could include in this update (mostly because its been so long), but I can't tell you guys EVERYTHING.  I keep the juiciest bits to myself. :P  But take care, all you guys, and keep writing.  If you keep writing, I'll keep writing. Deal?  P.S.  Sorry for the disconnected nature of this update.  I'm feeling a little scatter-brained. &#13;

       A guy named Michael is taking a U-Haul from Flagstaff to San Francisco.  I will be in it.  In a few minutes I'll be back on the road, travelling to what is supposedly the coolest city in the U.S.  I hope it lives up to its reputation. I will be staying with a friend of KT's who lives just north of the city.  I'm looking forward to painting the town red.  For the first time in a while I'll be in a place with a night life.  San Francisco, watch out!  Peace to you all! &#13;

       "So this thing goes on forever, right?" I ask. "Yup" replies Giuseppe. The pacific ocean.  I'm here on it's shore.  The tides, the roar, the immense power of waves that have travelled across the world to wash up on this shore, at my feet.  This is the first time I've seen the ocean - either ocean.  It seems odd that having grown up in montreal that I should see the pacific before seeing the atlantic. I am on the outskirts of San Francisco, living by the shore of the ocean at the house of a friend of KT's named Amy, and her roommate Gretchen.  It just so happens that they are never home, and essentially live with their respective boyfriends.  So, I have the house more or less to myself, oddly.  Last night, I went to the ocean; Giuseppe went skinboarding in a monkey costume; Amy and I watched the waves come in and greeted them barefoot.  I felt victorious, like I'd triumphed over something - I still don't know what - at having reached the other shore.  And I stared across it, into the haze, wondering where I would go next.  Will I be on that ocean soon, with this shore long passed out of sight?  Will I survive it?  My home is far away, now, as I look around and see palm trees.  Somehow the palm trees seem even more far away from home than the cacti did.  Tonight I'm going rock climbing.  Maybe tomorrow I'll try surfing.  Innumerable possibilities. Giuseppe, who lived in Quebec for a few months, has told me he will make me some poutine.  Apparently, curd cheese is illegal in the united states: some obscure law about uncooked food, apparently (?).  But Giuseppe has a hookup, he assures me, and we make the meeting next Sunday with two girls from Quebec who run a farm up north.   I'm going to go hit the San Francisco night life, tonight.  It will be glorious.  I haven't been in a big city in a long time.  There are some interesting possibilities I want to explore while here - I will elaborate later as my time is running out on this library computer. All my love, folks, all my love! &#13;

       The last few days were full of unexpected adventure.  I went back to the hostel I had previously been staying at to retrieve a couple of bags I'd left behind.  The visit was supposed to last 2 minutes, but instead lasted 3 days.  I was offered a free night's stay by a young american biker (motorcycle, not pedal-bike) who I had met during my previous stay (He was leaving but had already payed for an additional night he wasn't going to use).  Considering my fatigue and the long trip back to my relative's house that I had ahead of me, I decided to accept.  As I waited for the desk clerk to return to check me in, I met a beautiful british woman named Esther (currently living in London, I believe, though she's originally from northern England).  My friends at the hostel knew, before I did, that romance was brewing.  They insisted on giving us time alone when I invited them out drinking with us, though I thought that they were imagining things.  Why am I always the last to know?  Back in flagstaff, with Laura, we were nearly pressed face to face before she finally said to me, "You're really bad at making the first move, aren't you?".  And with Aramie: I thought she was gay, and that our being alone in her apartment drinking homemade screwdrivers was entirely innocent, when she kissed me.  Karine also took me completely off-guard.  When will I get a clue?!  Anyways, my friends were, of course, entirely correct.  Her beautiful, lilting northern-english accent (very soft and irish sounding, for those of you wondering) made me shudder every time she spoke.  And what conversations we had!  She's a sagitarius, for those of you who lend some credence to astrology, and very typical of her sign (as am I).  For once I didn't fall for a scorpio!  Thank goodness!  (Those of you who know my history with scorpios understand.  They're passionate... but nuts :)  hehehe)  Anyways, after an incredible evening, we ended up in the hostel sauna together (no, I still wasn't sure she liked me - idiot), and I never did end up using that free bed I was given.  The next two days were my best yet in San Francisco, and I think that my memories of San Francisco will center on these days, even though they were with an english girl who had never been to the city, and even though we didn't see much of it during those two days.  She left on a plane yesterday at 7:30pm.  If there weren't some mitigating circumstances I might have gone with her;  If there weren't some mitigating circumstances she might have stayed.  I suddenly understood something my friend Jon had told me before I left.  He told me that I would have time-compressed relationships on the road: relationships that run the full gamut of emotions over the course of the couple of days that they last.  I get it now, Jon.  Esther is gone, now, but the future is thankfully full of possibilities. &#13;

       The very fair criticism that I do not update my site enough has been levelled at me by several of my friends.  Very well, I'll do better (ya vultures).  I have bounced around all over San Francisco.  From one night to the next I have no idea where I'm staying.  The town is a little sleepier than I expected, but it is gradually growing on me, I have to grudgingly admit.  For those of you who are wondering, Lawrence Ferlinghetti IS alive, despite (probably Lisa's) insistence that he had kicked the bucket.  I am currently a block away from the city lights bookstore and spent most of my day there.  I assure you, he's alive.  I recently met a scottish relative of mine (second cousin, I think) who lives on the outskirts of San Fran.  I am currently staying with her and her Enlish husband.  Still no word on the curd cheese.  My patience has its limits, my friends :)  I've made some friends in the town, and am working on getting used to the cell-phones (NEVER!). "You DON'T have a cell phone?", asks a San Francisco local, flabbergasted.  Tomorrow I am going to the port of Oakland to try and get some cargo freighter work, destination unimportant.  They'll probably think I'm on the lam from the law!  What else, what else. Oh, I lost my goddamn helmet somehow.  However will I find another that fits my gargantuan-melon-head?  Well, that's it for now because this computer is not working right, and I can't actually see what I'm typing.  I hope this gets through! &#13;

       Merry Christmas all my friends!  You guys are the best friends anyone could imagine having.  Is the big gift exchange still on this year?  Or did Becky finally get tired of organizing it for all of us lazy bums?  Oh, and for those of you reading the 'competion' in addition to my on-line journal - I refer to www.boboucheaway.blogspot.com - it just so happens that in Quebec, we have a tradition known as reveillon, which takes place the night of the 24th.  Away for two weeks and she's already criticizing north america! :p Oooh, now you're european. Oooh lala aren't we the fancy pants. I love all you guys and wish you the best holiday ever (Ya, you too Sabrina, sorry about the jabs).  Well... not ever.  If it were the best holiday ever, I would feel somehow insulted. hehehe I will be spending christmas day with my relatives, here in Oakley, Ca.  After that, I will be hanging around Seaman's Hall in San Fran trying to scare up some ship-board work.  I'm being kicked off the computer, so take care of yourselves.  And for God's sake, smile! hehehe get it? get it?   Marc :) :] :} &#13;

       Happy new years everyone (if there's anyone out there).  I am in San Francisco for one more night, and then, tomorrow, back on the road.  Tonight I am staying at the green tortoise hostel, where there will be free food and alcohol.  Whoo! Also, some guy gave me a Les Claypool ticket for a ridiculously cheap price, because he couldn't use the ticket.  So at 9:00pm tonight I will be attending that concert.  It should be cool.  Let me know how your celebrations went.  Until later, auld lang syne and all that. &#13;

       Well, tomorrow morning I'll be heading back to San Fran for a couple of days.  After that, I will be back on the bicycle and headed north up the coast.  I look forward to coastal riding and giant redwoods and the like.  I am going to have to leave my typewriter behind, sadly.  I had purchased the typewriter in Flagstaff. I saw it in an antique shop and fell in love.  It is a beautiful black underwood portable, with round black keys and beautiful curves, highlit in chrome;  How could I resist?  Well, needless to say, it has been difficult to lug that thing around (it IS made of cast-iron).  Hey, no one said I was practical.  So my typewriter will be shipped back to Montreal to wait for my glorious return. :)  I started to write something that I hope will turn into a book on it (If I can stick with it long enough).  A few days ago I also met a girl from montreal (It was so nice to talk to a montrealer), who is intending to become a publisher.  I want to be a writer, she wants to be a publisher; Maybe we'll make each other famous!  I had a great conversation with her and look forward to getting back in contact with her when I get back to Montreal.    I don't know if getting aboard a cargo ship is realistic - at least not since september eleventh.  The ports are locked up tight.  So I'll start travelling north, and then see if I can join a travelling circus - people always suspected I would run away and join the circus, anyway.  I think that that would be an interesting way to travel east across canada (It will also save me from having to pedal across the prairies).  So now that I have rid myself of the typewriter, and am in the process of ridding myself of the extra clothes and whatnot that I have accumulated through a comparitively sedentary leg of my travels, I am road-ready again.  The coast, and nights camped on the beach, are ahead of me - after a suitable amount of new years celebration in San Fran. &#13;

       I've just crossed into Oregon.  Last night I camped on the outskirts of a little town just below the border, with the intention of going down to the local tavern to get a drink before going to bed.  I went to the closest bar (there are two in town), and got the usual you-ain't-from-around-here look before sitting at a barstool.  I asked the bartender if the bar picks up at all on a thursday night, to which she responded no, but advised me to go to the bar down the street, called the Bank (it used to be one), which "attracts a younger crowd.".  Well, the bar contained only a couple of people under 50 at its peek (I guess that IS a younger crowd around there), so I settled down to talk with a bar patron, figuring I might as well get a decent conversation in before going to bed.  Well, it turns out that this fella is a retired cocaine smuggler, and I got to hear about the two times he was shot, the three times he was stabbed, and the drug trade in general as he bought me drinks.  Now he confines himself to growing pot and living the humble life in small town california.  He offered me a place to stay for the night and to get me "completely fucked up", but I'd already pitched camp so I turned him down.  He provided me with loads of information about the surrounding areas, where to go and where to avoid, which I was quite grateful for.  Early this morning I got up to a somewhat rainy and miserable day, and crossed the oregon california border at a leisurely pace. &#13;

       Well, I've been back on the road a few days, now.  I spent some beautiful nights camped on the ocean's shore.  It's a good thing I didn't put my tent where I originally intended on that first night.  When I woke up in the morning, that spot was underwater!  I got a lift up the road about 10 miles from a genuIne hillbilly celebrity.  Apprently, he was Cletus on Hee Haw, starred in the Grand ole Opry and mentioned about five more hick shows he was involved with.  He's 65, now, and has a bum leg.  He also tried to convince me that I would be a fool to work for a living when I can buy real estate for no money down...  All in all, an interesting ride.  So, after a while I found myself in the california redwoods.  I camped in them a couple of nights and was awed by their enormity.  Beautiful area, this.  I am in an region that's considered "beyond the redwood curtain", whatever that means.  So eventually I turned up in Eureka, California, where a friend that I'd met in flagstaff lives.  Her name is Heather.  That's where I stayed last night, and will be staying tonight.  Tomorrow, though, I'll be back on the road and heading north at a leisurely pace.  These northern california towns sure are cute!  In a few days I'll be in oregon.  I wonder what I'll find there.  Incidentally, I'm going to try to make BC sometime (relatively) soon.  I'm running out of money and need to do some work before I can go much further.  Being somewhere where I'm actually ALLOWED to work might help. as under-the-table work sucks.  Life would be so much simpler if I didn't have to eat! &#13;

       Hello again from Eugene.  I have not left this bucolic little town, since I have now found a place to crash for a little while.  A student co-op living organization has graciously taken me in and given me my very own basement to live in. Whoo!  So, I've been auditing some classes at UofO and having some fun with the local college students.   University is so much more fun when you are not being graded!  I should have thought of this years ago!  So far I'm having a good time here so I think I'll stick around for a little bit before heading north.  Incidentally, soon I will have been on the road for 5 months, if my calculations are correct.  How the time flies :)   &#13;

       The sun will come out, tomorrow... bet your bottom dollar that tomorrrrrrow, they'll be sun.... I was singing that to myself after more consecutive rainy days than I had experienced along my entire trip.  Lo and behold, the sun finally came out in oregon.   I made a good distance that sunny day, despite a loose rear hub (for those of you who do not know bicycle lingo, that's the part that keeps the wheel from wobbling all over the damned place).  Eventually, after a few days out in the bush, I arrived in Eugene, Oregon.  Eugene is the home of the University of Oregon, which I decided would be a fun place to visit for a couple of days.  I have also repaired my hub and the bike is riding wonderfully for the first time in a while.  I'm about two days south of Portland - the big town in this region.  Also, I am about two days from Washington state, since portland is right at the top of the state.  So I might be heading up there tomorrow... we'll see.  I decided to treat myself to a hostel while in Eugene.  The hostel here sucks, however, and there's only one.  So if I can't find another place to live, I will say goodbye to Eugene in search of greener pastures.  I am currently in the university library and am going to go find a couple of classes to audit. &#13;

       Well, Sabrina's still reading my posts (she was the only one who responded to my query).  So this one's for you, Sabrina.  Well I left Crescent city and hit the southern oregon coast.  It has not stopped raining since I arrived.  Tired and disheartened, I pulled into Gold Beach, Oregon.  By this point I was so fed up that I decided that I would actually pay money for a campground.  So down I went to a campground on the coast, and was informed that I would have to pay upwards of $25 american for a night's stay. I was willing to pay maybe $4, I told the person running the campground.  Well, obviously this guy had experienced the hardships of the road before, because he decided to make me a deal.  He put me up in what is called a yurt, which is a huge domelike structure that was used in the himalayas? or something.  Anyways, it felt like having my own apartment.  The only catch was that I had to be gone before the manager arrived the next morning.  I had all the amenities and the comfort of a real bed.  Well, at night I went out drinking at the nearby bar.  On the way out I ran into a herd of about fifteen deer.  It was incredible.  I was five feet from them as they trotted across the street.  I had a moderately good time at the bar, and came back and got a very good night's sleep.  The next morning the fellow who had given me the incredible deal on the yurt made it even more incredible by making it free instead of charging me the four dollars we'd agreed on - he was feeling generous that morning, he said.  So I got back on the road (still in the rain) and along the way saw my first Road Runner - Meep Meep!  Anyways, I made it to a town called Port Orfard.  Along the way, I kept passing monuments to sunken ships:  Broken propellers, fragments of hulls, etc.  Why so many sunken ships in the area?  The WIND!  The wind was blowing so hard that I could not stay on the road (no exagerration).  I had to walk my bike, and could not stay on my feet - seriously.  Exhausted, I slipped into a fancy looking seafood restaurant.  I had decided that my suffering had entitled me to be bad;  I was going to order a meal that I could not afford.  So while I waited for my large fish and chips meal to arrive, I struck up a conversation with the nice lady seated at the next table.  Eventually, she left and one of the people in the restaurant turned to me and said, "Do you know who you were talking to?".  I replied no, so he went on, "She's the richest lady in the county!".  Anyways, this fellow started gossiping with the staff about this nice lady, and my waitress finally came with my meal, along with the bill, which said on it, "Paid for by the lady @ the next table."  That nice lady had paid for my meal on the way out!  Well, during our conversation, she had also told me about her yacht in Coos Bay, telling me that when I made it up there, that Nick, who is living aboard ship, would show me some hospitality.  I didn't make it very far outside of Port Orfard that night.  I got another flat tire (I have been getting them on a nearly daily basis these days), and was thoroughly frustrated.  I figure my tire had worn this and was letting just about every bit of debris through.  So I tried my hand at hitchhiking.  My attempt failed, so I set up camp behind the sign that says, "Welcome to Port Orfard.".  In the morning, I put in another inner tube and lit out on the road.  I was about two miles from Coos Bay when my tire popped again.  Frustrated, I rode the rest of the way there on the rim.  Well, when I arrived in Coos Bay, with the bicycle equivalent of a severe limp, I looked for the ship, the Discovery, where I'd been instructed to meet Nick.  Well, it wasn't hard to find!  It was the biggest damn thing in the harbor.  I was invited aboard the most luxurious ship - heck, it was the most luxurious PLACE I'd ever been.  I was dined and entertained and given the captain's quarters for the night.  Everything was on Nick's bill, there was no argument.  I spent a wonderful night aboard an incredible vessel.  And in the morning, I was driven to get repairs done on my bike - on Nick, of course.  And so with a new tire and an indestructible inner tube, I set back on the road, north.  And yes, it's still raining.  &#13;

       After having an interesting weekend full of drunken revelry, wheelchair fire-extinguisher fights, jazz and poetry in this small but active town, it is now monday - Martin Luther Kind Jr. day here in the states.  And today I bought a fancy pen as per the suggestion of a montreal girl I met in San Francisco.  It's not my typewriter, but hopefully it has some magic in it.  Tonight, I'm going to a concert.  Victor Wooten is playing down the street, and the tickets are ridiculously cheap, so I'll be there tonight.  It should be cool as I hear he is a bass god.  So I've met some interesting people here that I will have to describe later.  I am surrounded by environmentalists and hippies of the most delightful variety.  I've also met some cool people in 'my' classes - hehehe.  So I'll keep sending word of my adventures in Oregon, and how this concert turns out. &#13;

       Well, the last time I updated my site was a while ago; I didn't have access to a computer.  So the concert was incredible.  Victor Wooten certainly merits his reputation.  They pulled out all the stops in that little town.  I stuck around Eugene longer than I expected to for various reasons.  I actually got quite ill, probably due to the horrible exertions I've been subjecting my body to.  Essentially, I just broke down.  Even the chicken-pox virus that I had contracted as a child (and which has apparently been my faithful companion since), decided to capitalize on my moment of weakness and strike.  This I determined by throwing myself on the (absent) mercy of the most soulless organization in American society - no, I'm not talking about Starbucks Coffee, I refer to the American medical system.  These vultures insisted I sign a form in which I agreed to accept any charges that they might decide to impose upon me - without knowing what these charges would be.  In fact, no one would tell me how much seeing a doctor would cost until I had already seen a doctor, at which point I had already incurred the charges!  It was barbaric; More than that, it was extortion!  That was one reason I stuck around.  The other was a girl named Amber, who met me when I was far from at my best: not only sick as a dog, but drunk as a skunk to boot!  But nonetheless, she took to me and I to her and we spent a wonderful week together.  I stayed with her in her dorm and she played me beautiful music on her guitar and sang to me in english and in thai.  It was her sister who gave me a ride to Portland, where I am now staying.  Portland is a delighful city, one of the better american cities that I've visited.  The people here are friendly, on the whole, though there may be slightly more crazies here than is the national norm.  I stayed for a few nights at a hostel, sleeping in their yard to save money (which is getting tight, I'm afraid).  I made the acquaintance of a francophone Montrealer named Virginie, with whom I went drinking along with a whole cast of characters collected from the hostel.  We promised we would reconnect in Montreal when I get back and go down to Les Deux Pierrot - a place I haven't been in a while.  But she left the hostel eventually, and after an ill-fated infatuation with a wheelchair-bound Kentuckian named Joanna, I left as well - I just couldn't afford the hostel anymore.  But my good fortune has not yet left me, as a delightful young couple have taken me in for the last couple of days.  They live in a studio apartment not much larger than a walk-in closet.  I am amazed that, however good their hearts, they can bear to share what little space they have with a stranger.  My theory is this:  I noticed a litter box in the bathroom, but no cat.  Apparently, they had taken in a stray cat that had run away a couple of days later; I may be his replacement. :)  Either way, they apparently have an affinity for strays.  So I'm currently using the computer at the Portland State University.  I don't know how long I'll stay here, but I should probably stall a little bit so that by the time I get up to Canada, the winter will be on the point of breaking and letting me cross the rockies - homeward bound. &#13;

    &#13;
       One fine morning, to my own shock and surprise, I said to myself "I'm sick of Portland".  Ten minutes later I was on the road.  After spending a good deal of time wandering northern Portland trying to find a way across the Columbia river, I located the bridge and found myself in the great state of washington.  The next city that I passed through was Vancouver:  Vancouver, washington, not Vancouver, B.C.  And then onward I went, riding the I-5 north.  Well, let me tell you, there isn't much in Washington.  Besides Seattle and Olympia (the capital), which are quite near each other, the state is deserted.  So when my bike broke down catastrophically (the rear derailler got sucked into the back wheel somehow and was mangled beyond repair), needless to say, I was screwed.  So I had only two options: try to hitchhike, a strategy I had had no success with in the past; or walk to civilization, a prospect I also didn't revel.  So with little hope for success I stuck my thumb into oncoming traffic, but gave up two minutes later, convinced that no one would pick me and my broken bike up.  And so I started walking.  But I hadn't made it far before I noticed a pick-up truck by the side of the road; Surely he wasn't waiting for me, was he?  But he was!  An electrical worker heading home from a long day of work was waiting to drive me to the next city.  Though I disagreed with his politics, it was an entertaining ride.  And what's more, in a short time, I found myself in Olympia, Washington.  I went out to a bar, this seeming the only sensible strategy considering I had no place to sleep and no way to get anywhere; Clearly, I needed a drink.  But it wasn't long before I had found company.  A couple of charming girls, after taking the time to get to know me a little (i.e. to determine if I was a psycho), offered to put me up for the night.  So I had a warm place to stay for the night, and in the morning I made my way to the local college, Evergreen.  Evergreen is another extremely liberal american college that has dispensed with the idea of grades - much like Antioch in Ohio.  And why did I go there, you might ask?  It was rumored that they had a bike shop that I might be able to use to repair my poor bicycle.  I found it and was given, free of charge, a brand new derailler to put on my bike.  I learned a whole lot about bike mechanics there, and after an hour or so of work, my bike was rideable again.  I couldn't believe it!  The day before I had thought it would never ride again!  In the bike shop I met a lovely girl named Maya, who I hung around with for a while after my bike was fixed.  She invited me to a presentation of Casablanca (it WAS Valentines day), but I declined for my own reasons.  Anyways, I did end up crashing at her place that night.  In the morning I went back to Evergreen to set up my tent in the woods.  Evergreen is in the washington rainforest, and many of its students camp in the woods instead of paying dorm fees.  So I decided to stick around Olympia for a little bit before heading north.  Seattle is a day's ride away, and, Canada is not too far after that.  But for the moment I am sleeping in the woods and partying with the "Greeners". &#13;

       So it`s been a while.  So sue me :)  Where am I?  Victoria, B.C.  How did I get here?  Well let me tell you. Alright, so I was in Olympia, Washington.  I ended up getting involved with a girl named Erin at Evergreen.  That put an end to my sleeping in the woods - for awhile.  So I hung around the university and partied with the greeners, as I mentioned.  Well, after a while I was kicked out of Olympia and found myself back on the road.  And who kicked me out, you might ask?  The answer, unfortunately, is Erin.  Erin sort of fell hard for me, and she decided at a certain point that if I stayed any longer, then she could not have beared to see me go; According to her this meant I had to go then.  After appealing pointlessly to her logic, I got back on the road.  And it wasn`t long before I was sick.  There is nothing worse than being sick while on the road, especially when you could have been tended to by a beautiful woman just a couple of days earlier if she hadn`t kicked you out - not because she didn`t care but rather because she did;  Yup, that`s the worst.  And so I pondered that while in the washington rainforest, in which, not surprisingly, it was raining.  Oh, and have I mentioned that my tent has started leaking?  Did I mention that?  So I made it up to Port Angeles at the tip of the wahington peninsula.  After meeting a half native american half australian aboriginal psychic who has apparently been employed by the US government to detect terrorists (crackpot? maybe.  but I wouldn`t be greatly surprised if she was telling the truth), I went out to a bar where I met a lovely bartender who put me up for the night, before I caught my ferry to Victoria, B.C.  Well come the next morning, I was too lazy to catch the ferry, so I stayed another night at her place.  I went out again, where I met an elderly woman who has been suffering from multiple sclerosis for the last 30 years.  Well, the doctors told her that she would no longer be able to walk in a few months - 30 years ago.  And she was still walking.  She had taken it upon herself to help the whole world.  "It`s my job!" she insisted.  And she must have had at least 10 beers before she fell to the ground.  But she was OK, though clearly not sober enough to make it home on her own.  So I walked with her, next to the motorized cart she was driving, as she told me about her "little life", as she called it.  She was crying by the end of it, but I tried to calm her down, and, to keep her from drunkenly colliding with every passing obstacle.  So she didn`t hit EVERY obstacle, thanks to me, and I got her and her cart back to her apartment and we said  a bittersweet goodbye.  What a kind and courageous woman.  And the next day I took the ferry across the border.  And I was in Canada.  I found a little hostel to crash in that only charged $10 (Canadian, obviously), and later on I would get work exchange so I would no longer have to worry about paying for lodging.  And so now I`m looking for an actual income to replenish my funds.  Oh, and I`m going out on a nearly nightly basis.  I pulled the same scam as I pulled in Ontario, and hooked up with a university pub crawl, swiped a name tag and got free alcohol all night as I toured the bars of Victoria impersonating a geography student from the university of Victoria.  But this time, when we made it to the requisite karaoke bar, I WON the damn contest.  Or rather my team did, a victory that they credited entirely to my comical and painful-looking fall during a staged fight scene in our performance of Billy Jean.  Yeah.  And so my adventures continue here in Victoria. &#13;

       Well, despite my plan, I did not leave calgary today.  I'm sleeping on a couch in a fraternity at the university of calgary, in exchange for doing the dishes - a task which none of them seem brave enough to handle.  I went to sleep as the skies were clearing up; it seemed the rain was over.  And when I woke up in the morning, I did not hear the rain outside, so I considered that a good sign.  I climbed the stairs to find that three feet of snow had fallen in calgary overnight, and was continuing to fall at an incredible rate.  And the temperature had dropped drastically as well.  Simply stated, I would have risked death leaving today.  So maybe tomorrow. :) &#13;

       Alright.  It's been a long time, I know.  Well I stayed in Victoria for a while.  I did odd jobs to support myself in victoria, including laying sod, cutting flowers and driving a rickshaw (bicycle taxi).  As a bicycle taxi driver, I was also responsible for giving tours of the city - a city I had just arrived in and knew nothing about.  So, of course, I made things up.  Calling upon my skill at spinning yarns, I gave tours of the city like no other.  Did the american tourists know the difference?  No.  Will they ever?  Probably not. Despite having gone to victoria with the intention of steering clear of the opposite sex, I ended up involved in a doomed realtionship with a girl named Lindsay.  After that was over, I returned to the hostel and ended up getting involved in a love pentagon.  No, no, a love triangle is not sufficient for me, apparently.  It involved myself, and two seperate girls who were somewhat estranged from their boyfriends.  So that's 5 people.  I'm starting to think I might be a masochist.  Well, anyways, suffice it to say I left Victoria running.  I did have a good time there, however, and have fallen for a dutch goth-chick named Fleur, with long black hair and bright blue eyes.  She was working for the wilderness commitee, and protesting almost daily.  She's incredible, and may come to visit me in montreal in august, before going back to holland.  I hope so!  I have been dreaming of her during many cold nights.  I made lots of friends in victoria, including a fellow named Marty who wants me to come live on a sailboat during the summer.  Tempting.  In Victoria, I spent many a night partying around a campfire on the beach, and staring off dreamily into the ocean - good times I won't soon forget.  And then I left there, crossing over to Vancouver and then hitting the road.  My bike, a piece of scrap now, has been abandoned, and I am now relying upon my thumb to carry me home.  And so here I am in Calgary, Alberta, having passed though the splendour of the rockies to arrive here, one step closer to montreal.  I'll be home soon. &#13;

       It has been a while - a long while - since I've updated this site.  THis is going to be the last one for now.  Let's see if I can remember what happened since calgary.  At the University of calgary I met this cool guy who put me up in his house, and taught me to make some interesting and ingenious pot-smoking paraphanelia - information I have no intention of using ;)  He was from BC and was very happy to meet someone more liberal than the local albertans.  It seems that BCers and Quebecers both share more in common with each other than with their next door neighbours (Alberta and Ontario).  Well when the temperature perked up I got back on the road and was picked up almost immediately by a texan in a pickup truck.  He was utterly stereotypical.  He was an untamable, uncouth, uncultured man.  He had a son named Bubba and a daughter named something equally texan.  He was intolerant and bigoted, and made comments that made me wonder what century he was born in.  To summarize, I liked him.  What was most interesting about the ride was the fact that he had lost most of his memory in a car accident a few years back.  He was in Canada to retrace the steps of his youth, to try to resurrect his dead memories.  He would stop at towns and places when his faint recollections instructed him to, and would gradually recall the stories of his youth spent working in the oil industry in alberta, and training at canadian military bases during a war-time training exchange-program with the states.  We drank wine (Doctor's orders, to thin his blood) and talked about old times all the way to Winnipeg.  We both slept a night in the truck somewhere around Regina, or rather he slept and snored like a buzzsaw, keeping me awake all night.  We said goodbye in winnipeg and I got back on the road.  It wasn't long before I was picked up by a couple of 18 year old girls who thought I was cute.  They got me to this little town called Kenora, I think.  Cute town.  At one point, anfter getting a couple short rides, I found myself with my thumb in the air when a Ontario Government vehicle came by.  Well I almost retracted my thumb to attempt to play the innocent, but the guy stopped and offered me a ride.  Well, he was a government scientist, studying fish populations, I think.  Anyways, what he couldn't admit to his fellow scientists, for fear of ridicule, was that he believed himself to be gifted with the metaphysical gift of healing.   He regularly attended meetings of the psychically-adept, where he had further developped his skills.  We discussed philosophy and metaphysics and psychic phenomena all the was to Thunder Bay, where he and his wife - a fellow psychically-adept - put me up for the night.  Come morning I was driven to the highway, and resumed my trip.  I was picked up by a very quiet native-american man, and then by a very strange older man who was escaping from a romance with an eighteen year old girl, fearing her family's reaction should they find out.  Very strange man.  He was on his way to a cabin in the woods where he intended to grow copious amounts of pot so that he could live comfortably for a few years.   Having successfully avoided the town I had been frequently warned about by seasoned hitchhikers, Wawa, Ontario (also know as hitchhikers hell),  I found myself in Sault-Ste. Marie.  I got a couple more rides, including a ride from a crazy old german man, who drove his tiny little german-engineered (as he told me several times) car at incredible and terrifying speeds, and so found myself nearing nightfall on a very cold night, somewhere in god-knows-where ontario.  With the sun coming down, I gave one last ditch effort to get a ride, and finally flagged down a big rig!  I rode that truck to a truck stop just outside Sudbury.  I tried unsuccessfully to get a ride out of there to Ottawa, or directly to Montreal, and finally had to stay the night out back, on what turned out to be a very cold night.  It didn't help that I had managed to soak both my feet in the marshlands behind the truck stop before pitching camp.  Come morning my feet were freezing cold, and I went to  the truckstop to warm up.  The waittresses there were much less friendly than the one of the night before, and didn't let me stay long.  So I found myself outside and trying to hich a ride on a freezing cold morning.  Finally in desperation, I accepted a ride to ...  Toronto.  I rode with a couple of stereotypical Toronto boys with too much money and no manners.  He tailed a police car the entire way so that he could drive extremely quickly.  I'm surprised the policeman didn't stop him, but I suppose he was hurrying for a reason.  Anyways, I found myself in Toronto.  I walked along the 401 for awhile until a poilcecar stopped and picked me up for walking along the 401 (who knew that was illegal?).  I talked my way out of it and got driven a little further along, where I thoroughly failed to get picked up.  I tried to get my water bottle filled up at a couple restaurants, but they refused, but offered to sell me bottled water.  I used the last five dollars in my pocket to take the bus as far towards the edge of town as possible.  Eventually I found a truck stop, and snagged a ride out of toronto, thank god.  I was getting near home now.  I was at a truck stop now, almost entirely populated by francophones.   It was so nice to hear french again!  I tried to get a ride from some Quebecers sitting at a table.  With regret, they told me that they could not take me on board, because there were two weighing stations between there and montreal where they would be checked for passengers.  If a passenger were to be found, they would lose their jobs.  Well, I told them I understood, and took my sign and sat outside.  I was so close.  It was nighttime, and I was not eager to spend another cold night.  So I sat outside with my sign and gave it one more try.  Well, a truck stopped and gestured that I should come on board.  Wouldn't you know, it was one of the french truckers from the table, who had decided to risk his job in order to give me a lift.  The plan was this:  He would take me as far as the weighing station, and if it was open, he would stop the truck and I would jump out, no questions asked.  I agreed to the scheme.  Well, it was tense as we approached the first weigh station.  We were a caravan of three trucks.  The other two had gone ahead so that they could radio back the news.  As we approached he reminded me of the plan.  As we came upon the weighing staion, we found it closed, to our mutual relief.  But it wasn't over.  There was a second weighing station, and the odds of both being closed were slim.  And if the tension was thick before, it was doubly so now.  We watched closely ahead for the flashing lights that would indicate an active station.  They never came.  We were astounded by our luck, and once again I got the feeling that I was being watched over by some benevolent force.  I said my thankyous to the kind trucker, a south american immigrant who had made Quebec his home when he was rejected by ontario (When he became a successful business man, ontario invited him to live there and apologized for their error, but he told them that Quebec was his home now, and he told them what they could do with their invitation).  I found myself in Dorion.  I slung my backpack over my shoulder, and walked onto the island of montreal.  It was just where I left it. &#13;

       Well, the odds that anyone still checks this site on a regular basis are slim - but if there is anyone still out there, you should know that my posts will resume shortly: I'm going to Europe.  I've packed up my backpack and am almost ready to head out on what should be an incredible (albeit unoriginal) adventure.  But don't worry, I'll give the stereotypical European backpacking trip my own spin and flavour; Would I let you guys down? ;)  By the by, anyone I haven't heard from in a while should drop me a line (That means you, KT).  I've been out of contact for a while but I'm back now.  Those people I met along the road made my life richer and deeper - and I miss you all.  marc.lajoie@mail.mcgill.ca  p.s. Anyone I know in europe should let me know - I may just have to swing by and say hi :) &#13;

       Alright, I hope you folks have noticed the changes to the site:  Now you can give me feedback directly on the site (lower right, comment box) and there is also a hit counter which is directly linked to my self-esteem ;)  So on with the show.  I arrived in London a few days ago, at which point it occured to me that I probably should have gotten some information about where I was or where I was going before actually setting off.  No matter.  With a little resourcefulness I made my way through the London underground to the Bayswater district, and decided that I would hostel it for at least one night.  Considering that I had not slept all night, I figured it would be worthwhile to guarantee myself a bed.  So down to the local pub I went, once I had secured my belongings in the hostel, where I played a couple of games of British-Rules pool, or Snoooker as they call it, which is essentially pool except you can make really annoying shots until the other person wants to kill you.  And then I went home and fainted.  Nonetheless, despite my rather simple excursions, by mid-day the next day I realized that I had already spent a great deal of money, so I decided to get out of London before it should bleed my bank account dry.  So I found a cheap bus (though I paid the difference in other ways, as the bus broke down and the service was less than civil) to Nottingham, and dropped in on Sabrina and Richard, who were quite surprised to get a local call from me :)  So, I have been getting a guided tour of this historic city - I just went to the castle today and had a drink in the oldest pub in England, the "Trip to Jerusalem", a pub built into a cave - and have been fed and lodged in the newlywed's bucolic little house.  It is a good place to gather my strength before launching into the real adventure, to decompress from the stress of preparation, to recover from jet-lag, and to plan the next step. &#13;

       For anyone out there worried, I am indeed in London, England.  The trip went well and I have found a place to stay the night.  So, all's well.  No time to give a long update, but when I'm not paying for internet by the minute, I'll give you folks a proper earfull. :)   &#13;

    &#13;
       well I'm reduced to the hunt and pick method of typing, as the keyboards here are completely rearranged!  Why?!  Probably because they charge for internet by the hour...  So I left Sabrina and Rich's, and hitchhiked my way south.  I got a ride with a really nice scottish man who told me stories of his friend who had been on the run from the law, and who was finally caught, and hung himself in prison.  His friend, it seemed, lived at a million miles an hour, and burned away in the atmosphere.  They had grown up in the same poor neighbourhood, and he had taught my benefactor that you didn't need to be born with riches to live an incredible life.  It seems a shame that it was cut so short.  Next, an older scottish man picked me up and regaled me with tails of his glory days, when he was bumming around the world.  Time caught up with him, finally, as he assured me it would with me, and he has three boys and a wife now.  The boys are just old enough to be lighting out on their own journeys, now.  So I found myself on the outskirts of London, waiting at a truck stop for a ride out to Dover.  I waited a long while and was losing hope when an eastern european truck driver finally motioned for me to climb into the cab.  Our journey was a silent one as his grasp of english was tenuous at best, and my grasp of czech nonexistent.  So he drove me to Dover, and let me stay on the truck aboard the ferry to france.  And so I watched the white cliffs of Dover dissappear into the distance, and those storied beaches of Normandie appear at our bow from the windy deck of the ship, deserted except for me.  So I found myself in a town called Calais, France.  The first person I met, a blonde student at the local university, exclaimed in broken english, "Welcome to the ass-ole of France!".  I wasn't there 20 minutes before a crazy weirdo started following me around the streets.  Harmless enough, he seemed, but I wasn't in a mood to take chances, so I ducked into the nearest bar.  There, I met a french girl, a belgian girl and a french fellow, who instructed me on the difference between belgians and the french.  Well, last call came too soon, but my weirdo was gone, so we stopped by one of my new friend's house to get the champagne, and down to the beach we went.  We sat on the beach drinking and looking out at the faint lights across the channel - England - where I had been just that morning.  Finally, saying goodbye to my new friends I walked back out to the beach, to pitch my tent in the soft sand. &#13;

       Well, it's been a while, I know.  I'm still in france, still typing on a crazy keyboard.  I tried to hitch my way out of Calais, but it seems that Calais is one of those hitching black holes - a conclusion I arrived at after several hours of waiting by the rode, thumb in the air.  My two Lithuanian counterparts agreed, as they had been there for several days, trying to hitch to England.  Finally we all packed up and headed into town.  We hung out all evening, avoiding the caf</text>

      sick? what kind of sick? poor guy... hmm...i dun think that's the formula for life. in anycase, mine is "enjoy life but remember death." for me that sums it pretty nicely. toy? you bought me a toy? sickness....i dunno...this sounds dumb but if i were to apply what i'm learning...it's a way your body gets well...i mean....symptoms often arise cos your body is fighting/resisting antigens....so depends on how you look at it la... welll good luck with your fren's cousin.. take care get well soon &#13;

      damn. that prose is so true. wish there were more pple in this world who realised that.  am feeling damn pissed off now cos this guy who has been clinging to me for the past dunno how many months has suddenly announced that he never intended to make something out of it. i tell you if he was in front of me right now he wouldnt have teeth left.  i mean, fine he wants to be frens i'm ok with that, so dun la tell me you love me you miss me and then now you say that I'm the one who's perasan and thinks he likes me. what the hell?? i tell you i am so sick and tired of PERASAN guys ok...why is it they always think i like them, or worse still, they think i think they like me?? ish. can you please dont call our meeting a 'date'? i dunno...i dun like the word.  how about just a meeting of two pple who havent met for a long time? better?  i dunno. "dating" sounds so stressful. sorry for being so grumpy today. i just had to let off steam... &#13;

      seems that the tradition that i ha in JC is being carried on,.. used to celebrate 14th FEbruary as friendship day,..remember old frens, say hi,....buy them some stuffs,..exchange,..go out fer lunch or dinner,.. well,..this year seems to be juz smsing,..nvm,..am going for a chalet tomorrow,...free food,..=) thinking back abt my past, seems that my life is painted by frenz,...well, they come n go,...but some remains,...received an e-mail from one of the jjcian,...would like to share it wif u,...   Being Twenty-Something  They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are a lot of things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get hot and scared because you barely know where you are now.  You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you do not realize is that they are realizing that too and are not really cold or catty or mean or Insincere, but that they are as confused as you are.  You miss the comforts of college, of groups, of socializing with the same people on a constant basis. But then you realize that maybe they weren't so great after all.  You are Beginning to understand yourself and what you want and do not want. Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging a bit more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and add things to your list of what is acceptable and what is not. You are insecure and then Secure.  You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly change is the Enemy and you cry and cling on to the past with dear life but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away and there is nothing To do but stay where you are or move forward. The stupid ones plateau, the smart ones rise.  You get your heartbroken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you or you lay in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough to get to know better. You love someone but maybe love someone else.  You go through thesame emotions and questions over and over and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem tomake a decision.  You wonder what in the hell is wrong with you. We are making a lot of mistakes, but helping one another learn from them. We will piss one another off, and laugh at the end of a conversation that Started with angry words.  We are in our best of times And our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out. We are friends, and in 10 years we will be friends who have figured out where we fit in in this world. So don't be anxious about tomorrow, Live one day at a time.   &#13;

      since when do chinese girls like jocks? i thought they like anyone who's rich? :) the dinner ended at 12 actually..but we were hanging around taking pictures until 130 and by the time i got back it was 2am lah... i dunno...during the week i sleep very little, but when i come back during weekends i sleep like a log. like just now la balik rumah at 12noon...have been sleeping till now...it's 4pm... the lecturers are ok lah...not really handsome. some of the clinical doctors are la...but not the regular lecturers. i fell asleep in class yesterday and today..habis kena marah ngan my roommate for staying up late so how was the eco challenge?  saw a video on the riots in ambon and maluku yesterday nite..it was so upsetting...was reminded of it when you told me pasal sentosa and its parties..i mean our biggest problem normally would be what dress to wear to the next glam occasion but for these people it's matter of survival...it's so sad...such a big diff between countries that are not very far apart... sigh tie you up later then...:)   &#13;

Erm,..thats a long dinner,..wonder how it could stretch till 2am,..hey ya have enough sleep,..am imagining u to be walking like a zombie,..erm,.if its me,..not enough sleep plus morning lecture = a good sleep in the lecture theater... maybe ur reason for attending lecture could be that of a charming lecturer that keeps the eyes opens,..had that in jc,..sexy teachers = a muz to attend lecture,..=) arghhh,...now that u mentioned eco challenge,..gotta wake up in the wee morning to make my way to Bt Timah Fire station,..(meet the rest of the team mates)..then go to Sentosa,.. Erm,..Sentosa,..is now known for its parties,...foam party, black moon party, chicks in bikinis,..groove from 6pm till 6pm,..too bad i dun like to be at such scenes,..(tak balik nanti,..=P) hey dun juz catch me,..tie me up, cuff me,..anything,..but never let go,..k?  sands mixed with water, muddy chemistry,  but will settle to be of separate entity.  &#13;

      eh...next time service la the bike properly nearly had a heart attack reading the line that you had an accident how's your fren? i suppose most brilliant people end up being mad cos they cant relate to the rest of the population and vice versa. the problem with the general public is that they are so narrow minded. i dont know which category i fall in tho.:) studying is fun..gee that sounds like the bookworm club slogan...i mean if you approach it properly...must make sure you leave room for other stuffs too la where you working now? as in, the part time job thingy i agree with you about the exes can be good frens kinda thing but it also depends on how you break up. i mean like with my ex(the most recent one) we were so close during the relationship...and i know him inside out...can anticipate what he's gonna do in what situation...but i dont think he even remembers what i like. i know he does..but cos he was two timing me..i find it hard to talk to him...i mean how can i ever trust him again, you know? but we are still very close la...it's just that it's a one sided thing...he talks i listen...and besides...i dont really like to talk to non-boyfriends about my personal problems...prefer to figure it out myself... his gf dumped him last night...he was so upset he sounded insane...i wonder if he was that upset about me leaving him...i dont think so since he already had a replacement in the sidelines i dunno why i'm still frens with him...he causes me so much hurt...but i suppose we go way back...so i guess i do care about him in some way   &#13;

      itz ok for me to be a madman,...taking it as a compliment,..=) ever heard of plato's analogy of the cave,..the madman was a genious,..kind of like einstein n other weirdos,.. if you never hear abt it before,..i'll be glad to tell you his analogy,..well,..learn a bit of philosophy from my art project,..=) guess wat,..had an accident juz now,..=( well,..no major injuries juz bruises,.. was on a bike wif my colleague,..(nak gi kerja part time),..bike jammed in the middle of PIE,...swoosh,..white van missed us,..bang,..blue lorry hits us,...the back box was smash,..nearly hit on an incoming car,..selamat my reflex is quick,..alhamdulillah masih dapat chat dengan dia,..well,..bike dah stall,..damaged badly,..gotta thank the box though,..kind of cusion the impact,.=)  tell u wat,..honestly ,..you are my dream ger,..well,..since my childhood.. am using u as an inspiration,..(well even though am not in contect wif u,..gotta have role model, rite) erm,..calling u my dream will be to ridiculous of couse,..well,..lets make it a make belief,..of coz u dun have to be wat i think u are or anything,..its juz me feeling my void of emptiness,..its good to dream u know,.. erm,..haven't been studying for a year now,..kind of misses it,.  i find it funny how people sees a relationship.to me relationship, premaritally is about being the closest of fren of the opposite gender,..well of coz u can have a close guy fren without a relationship, but juz add love as in feeling to it,..even with the "love" diminshes, n relationship ceases,..dun think that frienship freezes,..he still knows you better than some other friend,..know wat you are like,..your likings n stuffs,..still could be best of buddies,..well,..am like that wif my ex,..erm,..only have one,..therefore the ideology seems to work for me,..dunno abt you,..seems to have lots of them,..-bad publicity,..  abt parents' midlife crisis,..seems that being at home to be a perantara does work here,..ben watching mum n dad playing crouching tiger, hiddn dragons for eons now(erm,.haven't watch the show)..least family is not that rocky yet. opps,..i'll be back,..&#13;

      oh god...i think i have just connected myself with a madman.. heh. so what you up to? what is it about me that you wanna know? and what is it that you wanna tell that your inner conscious is not letting you tell? hmm..that's the prob with talking with a poet always got isi tersirat :) erm..about me... sigh am still very much a studious person for a while i tried to change it and be hip and happening but i think i like myself better this way and besides i like what i study even though my friends say it's quite morbid cos i look at corpses every other day but i like it just hope i can pass the dratted exams it's REALLY difficult ish love life...nothing much i'm kinda over my last ex there's this sarawakian guy who is kinda hovering around but not really making any moves so i'm not gonna bother that much then there's you... then there's that silly guy who tells everyone i like him but tells me he likes me...duh... so i dunno i mean priority for me will always be studies and family and family these days aint so stable my parents are going through mid life crisis so i dunno think i should be home more often to jadi perantara that's the prob when you are the eldest the whole family's burden is on your shoulders whether you are a guy or a girl and somemore my brothers and i are quite far apart in terms of age but we are close la but you know...i cant really tell them that my parents are fighting kan...kesian la pulak... &#13;

      arghh,..for the firs time in my life,..i've been sabotage,...adding the spice to it,...by my own relatives,.. well,..its my cousin's one year old b'day,..theres a family gathering ,.well, a party,. went on, a happening one i might say for a 1 yr old,.felt that i better keep mump abt THE day,..dun intend to celebrate it,.bought for him two cute socks,..hehee,.. after the party, the cousins planned to go bowling, of coz gotta have some adult(kalau tidak siapa nak belanja),..had fun at the bowling alley. Then we went to Bt Gombak to eat,..erm,..they did gave some hint abt the sabotage,..like" erm,..so who's gonna be home the left overs(curry, sambals n dalca)"..din realise it though..when its parting time, my brother promt for the others to go to the car, to take some berkat from the b'day party. so,..all of followed,..in the middle of the bringe,(was engrossly talking to my cousin),..kapoom,..AN air raid of flour and eggs,..was caught by surprise. ..  Erm,..when i reached home, took a look at the mirror, realised something. My hair was white, ...then told myself, no wonder they uses flour for b'day,..kind of makes me looks older,..maybe thats wat it's suppose to symbolise, The coming of age. The egg, seems to be seen as the "birth",.. conclusion, age is the lost of youth,  Hey, you take care now,..had a good ay juz now,..n my room,..its pretty neat,.=) wished that you are here,.....@hugzzz@ &#13;

      they say life is straight, u live to die.. i'll say, life is dead.  just gonna comment on something. seems that we men are funny. we tend to like pretty ladies. and most of our crushes are damsels. so wats the true defination of love at first sight.. erm,..am getting alot of it lately.. they say that beauty is found in the inner self. but seems that many have that that beauty. get to know many girls with great hearts. then again, confucious once said"every man are born a good seed". arghh...love is funny. but one thing for sure, getting to know someone is special. you dun say hi to everyone, u'll meet up somehow..well, to me this is the beauty of fate. I think that fate is the searcher of ideal couple. a cupid in the form of time. thats y most people are attached from within their social circles.  Dunno abt you, but from my own experience, one could adapt to changes. Wat can i say, life is a big stage. Acting well is the best way to be kept on-stage.  &#13;

      hmm...piles is not caused by heatiness. what la you. ahem. it's caused by not going to the toilet often enough and then when you do, the pressure builds up and the veins in your anus enlarge and protrude out, and the possibility of it bleeding once it has protruded is more. there's only 3 major veins in the anus and they kinda go around it so...moral of the story...eat lotsa fibre, drink lotsa water, and go to the toilet regularly. make sure when you do your stool is soft. ok...? heh...this is the doctor speaking. :) NS..i dunno. i think it's ok la just that most people have trouble getting back to complete their studies after that. dah lama sgt tk study kot...its good for the girls la...cos once they reach uni the guys will be 2yrs older...more matured...:) take care  &#13;

      hello. i dun think you come here anymore but just in case you do i thought i'd just leave a word or two.   how are you? i havent heard from you in a long time. you didnt reply my mail and i dunno whether it's because you didnt get it or you havent been online or what. i hope you are okay.  it really was nice seeing you the other day. i had no idea you grew so tall.  i was supposed to go back singapore next week for a fren's wedding, but my father didnt let me go. he didnt really give a reason. i was hoping id see you again then. guess not.  back to studying again...and am enjoying it this year cos i'm not as lost as last year. and i just bought a brand new stethoscope!! i'm so proud of it you know. like it's a symbol that i'm getting closer to achieving my dream or something.   hope to hear from you.   &#13;

      welcome to the real world,..no red carpets shall be staged for u, nor ladies with rose petals to grett you.. just some clothes and an identity card to say that its you. well well,..seems that as one grows older, reality bites deeper. am gettintg the hang of it =P ok, am having a movie marathon ever since the long medical leave. watched 12 movies,..two more in the cinemas,..reign of fire and a mafia thingy(well people forgets) let see, seems that patches of these movies are bringing sense into me,... well,..am pretty awaken,, seems that the phrase "wat goes around comes around"(art of war) seems to be bugging me,.. every action will have a reaction had my blues of courting. seems that one will never be satisfied with something, there will always be another that one will want.well, thats wats happening to me,...am being choosy,..too choosy actually. i dunno, no one is perfect enough. or issit i'm not perfect enough. well, i've found out that both comes together. First, one tends to be choosy,.." is she the right one,..no, she dun look good enpugh, no, she burps,..no, her hair, i dun like her hair,..her speech,..the slang's too much",..but when one finds the "perfect" one..."hey,..i'm not good enough for her,..hey, maybe next time,..erm,..today is not a good day to ask her out,..hey eheyhey... seems that i'm never contented,..therefore,..its better to be alone,..well,..its not the right time thats for sure,.. There has always been a broplem with money,..have enough to go out on my own,..dun think i have the space for another,..not on my account that is,..its hard to ask a girl out if one dun treat her,..it seems so, not right. i dunno,.people say time have change, people are going Dutch, well,..i feel awkward if i dun treat a girl out, dun think i could manage if a girl treat me out,..Its not an EGo thing,..i dun do these stuffs in front of people, am not showing off,..maybe i'm brought up this way,..or maybe girls never prompt to go dutch,..maybe,..i dunno.  ok, am setting something in life,..knowledge wise,..since we live only once, i dun see the thing for specialisation without an all rounded education, i think one have to be taught all aspects of life, say it, nautical, engineering, maths, history, geography, architecture,religion, computing,arts, name it. with these broad aspects of knowledge i think one could find contentment in understanding,..philosophy is a great form knowledge which i very much like. Seems that its the basis of knowledge,..well it keeps me pondering, keeps me thinking, why this, why that.maybe its like this maybe its not. One thing for sure, one shouldn't spend each day on just one thing, but on everything. Socialising is a study, walking is a study, seeing is an observation, hearing is a disipline, everyday life is a great act, eating is a good testing, sleeping is a magnificant fantasy builder, talking is an interection, exchanging of ideas, well practically everything is something, its just up to one to actually make full use of knowing.   ok ,..hand's aching, gotta rest,..nightz,..i'll be back,.. to myself,&gt;&gt;&gt; you are you,be somebody, not nobody, not just a name to be engraved but to be seek and known,..&#13;

      ok,..shoots,..am having morbid thoughts,.. dreamt about dead relatives and colleagues,(damn). seems that when someone leaves this realm,..theres a loss in both world,..the deceased gonna leave everything he/she once had posessed, and the people was left could only remember him by and wait for time to consume their fate,..funny episode in this dream is when one of my colleague tries to bring everything he have,..but ended with only a tombstone was quitee cute,..Things just gets deleted away (ni ariff main game banyak sangatlahni) but one part of the dream seems to be an eye opener,..my uncle have lots of multimedias(cameras,video cams, tv, Hi-fi,tv monitor), when he pass away, it seems that the relatives gets choosy in getting the things he left behind.well,i got myself a digital cam,..=p.but the funny part is that my supposed dead uncle seems to be ushering the relative to his stuffs.  another humourous death, my Warrant officer, a chinese, so called died, but his grave was in the muslim cemetery, he was surprised by this, and asked the rest of the tenants why issit his lot is so small. erm,..how come i could see the 'dead' talking on their graves.  Well, thats just a dream. but seems to last throughout the whole of my sleeping duration yesterday.but one thing for sure i've never been having thoughts of seeing them dead as soon as possible before.am having a big question mark for why issit that the 'deads' are people whom i seldom thought about.  okok,..today's eerie feeling, got goosebumps while reading the articles on september 11th. Suddenly theres a thought thst something will happen today or tomorrow, and i'm gonna be there to experience it.oh ya, one more thing, about the dream, i'm one of the dead also...thats why i'm writing this down....   &#13;

      okz,..life is full of surprises Droplet of water, Ceasar or the hour. Contracted fever, Tongues turns sour.  Cyles of life, evolution and death. Spawning and marks,  Scar of birth.  King of own realm, Slave to others. One of its kind, similar to others.  Inevitable to the minutes, opaque to fate. catastrophies we are hooked, transparently walks through the eternal gate.  Whats sweet? whats nice? Bitterness a boon  and sweetness a bane in disguise. SO why not suffer, why not be in pain. Eternity last forever  And thats fate unchanged.&#13;

      well,..that depends now, on which group of gers u r with,..most of the gers i know are very friendly pple. of coz theres a few back stbbers here n there. Menjadi lumrah alam for those gossipy type to be around. So gotta choose wisely =p. Well,..religion wise, could group into category, those who really practise th religion n those who r pretending to. Basically i think that the latter just wanna find a "good" future hubby, a five minute thingy to show that they r religious. Wears the tudung for a month, back to square one after that... Most of the pple are repenting, starting off from scratches, u can see the steps they make, not too sudden, but slowly. Maybe its the school culture that make the local muslim mature religious wise slowly,.. erm..ni ada ura ura nak balik singapore lah ni,....=) aniwae, selamat berpuasa,..=)...a week to go to Raya...=)&#13;

      no la i have no intention to balik singapore..i think my chances there are limited...as in i wouldnt be able to reach my full potential without compromising my faith. i guess the same goes for any minority groups. so..i guess i better stick to where i am the majority. then, mebbe, after im done here, ill go back and see what i can do for the people there. but im not sure its a gd place to raise my kids. if i have any by that time. i mean, i very nearly screwed up my chances while i was there. i dowan my kids to go thru that. so...selamat hari raya and maaf zahir batin ok...&#13;

      seems that life is unpredictable. age changes one's life how could i ever morph into an adult leaving sweet memories of a child how could i forget how could i not cry path thought time adds weight to one's experiece  but forgo one's innosense roots rot, leaves branched out Time will come when the tree will fall &#13;

      Good thing for guys,a new experience, better perspective to the working world, i mean its like being given a job. National service exposes us to the real singaporeans thats inhibiting the country, i mean, one can't avoid the "gangsters, gays and such" makes one adapts to them, ..making us more open. For some it is the first time in their life, they are given a responsibility to do something, kind of making them more independent. Physically, its taxing but sculpturous, wat else, in my kind of work, i get to interect with the public, am able to understand the needs of the local population in a bird's eye view. wat else, NS foster friendship to a larger circle of cliques, could be good, or bad cliques, that depends on how one chooses friends. Erm, there's a bad thing abt NS, kind of waste one's time, especially in terms of education. a two to three years gap of being in another line kind of makes one loses focus. Honestly in country like singapore whereby everything well, almost is spoon fed, NS kind of counter the silverspoon legacy,  overall, NS is a good thing, but its up to individual to take advantage of it or perished with the negative influence. My opinion is to enjoy National service and try to excell in in, make oneself more competative, look at it as a free training to the real world, not a simulation,.... and dear, how are you?&#13;

      ha, had a new philosophy about life,.....  we are born on the beach our path is to the islands ahead we start off on the sandy ground, slowly moving to the gentle waves here we still have the sands to support us, legs first, then knee and up to the rest of the body. at a certain point we'll have to jump about, and starts to swim,.. if we give up swimming, we'll drown as we swim to the open ocean, the waves gets rougher if we tire off, we'll drown. be persistant and swim on, till we are near to an island we gotta choose the islands  some of the islands have beast that are carnivores,some herbivores or theres both some islands are small, some are big on the small island, we might get bored, so we'll move on to a bigger island on the bigger island, we migt get lost, so, we might find the beach and head off to another island till one finds utopia, its and endless cycle but still, throughout the journey, one must go on, not stopping, for one's survival depends on it.   &#13;

      think that it was in the 95,..or issit 90, erm,..93 issit..ok,checked the date,it was early 1991... bet u din recall anything bad about the war till much later.... well,..not about internal politic i'm worried about. More of the religious propaganda...&#13;

      dunno lah..i guess its good we have wide access to media coverage and all..but it still doesnt mean we know everything..with politics you never know. but with what we have at least we can make our own judgement abt what's going on rather than having things rammed down our throat. gulf war..how old were we? &#13;

Now that we are liberated to free media, everything seems to be coming to us in a messy way. hated the way US intervine the other countries kind of ungentlemenly. ha, talking about democracy us,  being the head of it all,..hahaa Erm,..maybe bush is the next lamb,..ha then again y not.. &#13;

      i think the situation in the world today is so sad and depressing we should do all we can to cheer ourselves up. i think ISlam is a great religion if the people go back to the roots of it, and put aside their egos and eccentricities adnd concentrate on strengthening the ummah instead of their own selfish gains.  i think iraq and palestine are countries which should be helped but i think the US since its lead by a complete dimwit-shouldnt be in charge of it. its so dangerous to put just one country in charge of running the world. i mean, all the guy seems to do is attack people-when his own country is at its lowest since 1987. i dunno. i just think its wrong. and i think everyone's so desperate that they themselves resort to violence.&#13;

      (live life the fullest) we'll never going back to the past, so why not play with the present.  ha, been doing lots of thinking lately. y bother to live, y bother to study, y bother to be a civilian, y this y that .. religion and its authenticity i mean seems that all religions are the product of history. Its validity is questionable. look at the current news. We are still not sure wats happening at IRAQ and what is written in history, US on war with iraq to salvage prisoned nation.hahaa,..right. we r looking at technology and communication at its peak. well, not trying to say that i dun belief in religion. just rational thoughts..guys,..am still a muslim =P  booo,..ariff, got lots of assignments to be done,................. bye &#13;

      haha tak main lah all this catfights all...if you want her you've got her...:)  i think ultimately the desicion in a catfight(?) belongs with the guy. if i was ever in one, i think ill just ask the guy to choose and if its not me then ill leave the happy couple alone. its not worth it you know? why force someone to be with you when he likes someone else? just a thought. so you dun think yr gf is the right one at the mo? haha i tell her then you know... not like i know her anyway. school's starting in 2 weeks. im starting to feel like ive wasted my hols doing nothing...i hate this feeling..it always comes when hols are about to end...bencinya... i wonder what studying in a hospital for real will be like..i mean yes ive had patients last year, but this year its like for real...scarynya.... &#13;

      i dun get you? what kinda game? and im sorry for not blogging in sooner, i started school liao. and having loads of fun cos this term no exams. but i still study cos its interesting. and no stress. life couldnt be better thank god. i didnt really notice the trend...to me most singaporeans dress up too much. mungkin cos im used to the people here being quite lepak in dressing. and dont follow trends, somemore most of my frens cant afford designer togs. so how are you and school and work and stuffs?  take care. &#13;

      i dunno it feels unfair to be in a relationship and not give your whole heart when you can...i guess thats part and parcel being in a relationship la, its a risk you have to take.  fwah so you are gonna bring who down? for your concert that is. bring..kylie minogue..i bet a lot of adolecent boys would love that...:) &#13;

      haa,..shall be indirect in my words.. like losing a lost toy, one yearns to see it again. of the memories intact and the bond shared, one yearns to see it again.  of the future planned, one yearns to plan it again. maybe it's a missing piece  maybe its a passing cloud. but what can i say, its a missing portion tt's been in need to be patched. but time have passed. any many things sets in. lots of things that makes the future uncertain. if wats nudging is true and pure, maybe it'll come back to the past  haa,..no worry, told gf that this page is out oof bound for her. However, i've told her that an intrusion will be of her own consequences...  thanks for the msg..it's a sweet move...=) &#13;

      what about yr chances of upgrading yr diploma to a degree? in st marine? i seriously think you should do it...in this times of uncertainty...at least you'll have a job at the end of it.&#13;

      degree program - NTU/NIE bachelor of arts specialising in language. The scholarship's for my diploma in marine and offshore,..basically an allowance of $10000 n two years bond. &#13;

       &#13;
      ok wait...so what exactly have you been doing all this while? i think the st marine thing sounds good... i guess im biased cos my dad worked at the shipyard. i mean, put it this way, its the only thing you've got a scholarship for. and i think that makes matters alot easier cos you dun have to really think about tuition fees. cos i dun think you're really cut out for teaching, i dunno. what exactly is the scholarship for? yr degree pro is for what? im confused here, you've gotta spell things out a bit... take care &#13;
